Thanks for your interest in helping out conda-forge.

Whether you are brand new or a seasoned maintainer, we always appreciate
feedback from the community about how we can improve conda-forge. If you
are submitting a PR or issue, please fill out the respective template. Should
any questions arise please feel free to ask the maintainer team of the
respective feedstock or reach out to `@conda-forge/core` for more complex
issues.

In the case of any issues reported, please be sure to demonstrate the relevant
issue (even if it is an absence of a feature). Providing this information will
help busy maintainers understand what it is you hope to accomplish. Also this
will help provide them clues as to what might be going wrong. These examples
can also be reused as tests in the build to ensure further packages meet these
criteria. This is requested to help you get timely and relevant feedback. :)

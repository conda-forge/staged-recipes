  Hi friend! We really, really, really appreciate that you have taken the time
  to make a PR/issue on `conda-forge/staged-recipes`! `conda-forge` only exists
  because people like you donate their time to build and maintain conda recipes
  for use by the community. In an effort to maintain this repository and increase
  the signal-to-noise for open PRs/issues, the maintainers of `staged-recipes` close
  excessively old PRs/issues after six months. This PR/issue will remain open
  for another month, and then will be closed. If you'd like to keep it open,
  please comment and we will be happy to oblige! Cheers and thank you for
  contributing to this community effort!

  Hi again! About a month ago, we commented on this PR/issue saying it would be
  closed in another month if it was still inactive. It has been a month and
  so now it is being closed. Thank you so much for making it in the first place
  and contributing to the community project that is `conda-forge`. If you'd like
  to reopen this issue, please feel free to do so at any time!
  Cheers and have a great day!

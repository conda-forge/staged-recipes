  Hi friend!


  We really, really, really appreciate that you have taken the time
  to make a PR on `conda-forge/staged-recipes`! `conda-forge` only exists
  because people like you donate their time to build and maintain conda recipes
  for use by the community.


  In an effort to maintain this repository and increase
  the signal-to-noise for open PRs, the maintainers of `staged-recipes` close
  excessively old PRs after six months. This PR will remain open
  for another month, and then will be closed.


  If you'd like to keep it open, please comment/push and we will be happy to oblige!
  Note that very old PRs will likely need to be rebased on `main` so that they can 
  be rebuilt with the most recent CI scripts. If you have any trouble, or we missed
  reviewing this PR in the first place (sorry!), feel free
  to [ping the team](https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/infrastructure.html#conda-forge-admin-please-ping-team)
  using a special command in a comment on the PR to get the attention of the
  `staged-recipes` team.


  Cheers and thank you for contributing to this community effort!

  Hi again! About a month ago, we commented on this PR saying it would be
  closed in another month if it was still inactive. It has been a month and
  so now it is being closed. Thank you so much for making it in the first place
  and contributing to the community project that is `conda-forge`. If you'd like
  to reopen this PR, please feel free to do so at any time!


  Cheers and have a great day!

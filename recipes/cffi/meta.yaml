  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for Python 2.7, 3.4, and above, for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<34]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.4 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.

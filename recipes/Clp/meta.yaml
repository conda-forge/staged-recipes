  summary: 'COIN-OR linear programming (Clp)'
  description: |
    Clp (Coin-or linear programming) is an open-source linear programming solver.
    It is primarily meant to be used as a callable library, but a basic,
    stand-alone executable version is also available. It is designed to find
    solutions of mathematical optimization problems of the form

    minimize c'x such that lhs ≤ Ax ≤ rhs and lb ≤ x ≤ ub

    CLP includes primal and dual Simplex solvers. Both dual and primal algorithms can use matrix storage methods provided by the user (0-1 and network matrices are already supported in addition to the default sparse matrix). The dual algorithm has Dantzig and Steepest edge row pivot choices; new ones may be provided by the user. The same is true for the column pivot choice of the primal algorithm. The primal can also use a non linear cost which should work for piecewise linear convex functions. CLP also includes a barrier method for solving LPs.

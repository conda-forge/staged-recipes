  summary: 'A noGDAL tool for reading geotiff files'
  description: |
    Python-geotiff is a library that reads geotiff files without
    the need for GDAL, a program that was not built with Python in mind.
    "noGDAL" is a philosophy for developing geospatial programs in
    python without using GDAL and python-geotiff aims to provide a
    GDAL-less means of interfacing with geotiff files.

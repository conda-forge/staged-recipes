  summary: Fast Change Point Detection via Sequential Gradient Descent
  description: |
    Implements fast change point detection algorithm based on the paper
    "Sequential Gradient Descent and Quasi-Newton's Method for Change-Point Analysis"
    by Xianyang Zhang, Trisha Dawn <https://proceedings.mlr.press/v206/zhang23b.html>.
    The algorithm is based on dynamic programming with pruning and sequential gradient
    descent. It is able to detect change points a magnitude faster than the vanilla
    Pruned Exact Linear Time(PELT). The package includes examples of linear
    regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression, penalized linear regression
    data, and whole lot more examples with custom cost function in case the user
    wants to use their own cost function.

  summary: "A fast, scalable genome analysis system"
  description: |
    ADAM is a library and command line tool that enables the use of Apache Spark
    to parallelize genomic data analysis across cluster/cloud computing
    environments. ADAM uses a set of schemas to describe genomic sequences,
    reads, variants/genotypes, and features, and can be used with data in
    legacy genomic file formats such as SAM/BAM/CRAM, BED/GFF3/GTF, and VCF,
    as well as data stored in the columnar Apache Parquet format.
    On a single node, ADAM provides competitive performance to
    optimized multi-threaded tools, while enabling scale out to clusters
    with more than a thousand cores. ADAM's APIs can be used from
    Scala, Java, Python, R, and SQL.

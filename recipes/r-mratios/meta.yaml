  summary: With this package, it is possible to perform (simultaneous) inferences for ratios
    of linear combinations of coefficients in the general linear model. In particular,
    tests and confidence interval estimations for ratios of treatment means in the normal
    one-way layout and confidence interval estimations like in (multiple) slope ratio
    and parallel line assays can be carried out. Moreover, it is possible to calculate
    the sample sizes required in comparisons with a control based on relative margins.
    For the simple two-sample problem, functions for a t-test for ratio-formatted hypotheses
    and the corresponding Fieller-type confidence interval are provided assuming homogeneous
    or heterogeneous group variances.

  summary: The easypar package makes it easy to implement parallel computations in R. To use
    this package, you need to have a function that carries out your desired computation.
    easypar will take care of the burden of turning that function into a runnable parallel
    piece of code, offering a soilution based on the foreach and doParallel paradigms
    for parallel computing, or generating array jobs for the popular LSF workload for
    distributed high performance computing.

  summary: 'Library for maximum likelihood principal component analysis for AnyBody models'
  description: |
    sillywalk is a Python library for statistical modeling of human motion and
    anthropometric data with the AnyBody Modeling System. It implements Maximum
    Likelihood Principal Component Analysis (ML‑PCA) to learn compact,
    low‑dimensional models from datasets, predict missing or individualized
    signals from partial inputs, and export those predictions as AnyScript
    include files that plug directly into AnyBody models.

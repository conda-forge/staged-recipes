Subject: [PATCH 3/4] python: Do not link against python lib for building an
 extension module.

This fixes a segmentation fault when trying to use the python module on
OSX when built with conda (unsure why it doesn't arise otherwise).
Instead of linking against the python library, it is proper to not link
against the library and, for OSX builds, add linker options for
"-undefined" and "dynamic_lookup". This is precisely what the CMake
FindPython module does for linking against the Python::Module target.

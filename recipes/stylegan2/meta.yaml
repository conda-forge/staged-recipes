  summary: 'A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks'
  description: |
    We propose an alternative generator architecture for generative adversarial
    networks, borrowing from style transfer literature. The new architecture leads
    to an automatically learned, unsupervised separation of high-level attributes
    (e.g., pose and identity when trained on human faces) and stochastic variation
    in the generated images (e.g., freckles, hair), and it enables intuitive,
    scale-specific control of the synthesis. The new generator improves the
    state-of-the-art in terms of traditional distribution quality metrics, leads
    to demonstrably better interpolation properties, and also better disentangles
    the latent factors of variation. To quantify interpolation quality and
    disentanglement, we propose two new, automated methods that are applicable to
    any generator architecture. Finally, we introduce a new, highly varied and
    high-quality dataset of human faces.

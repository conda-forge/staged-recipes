  summary: Setup and retrieve HTTPS and SSH credentials for use with 'git' and other services.
    For HTTPS remotes the package interfaces the 'git-credential' utility which 'git'
    uses to store HTTP usernames and passwords. For SSH remotes we provide convenient
    functions to find or generate appropriate SSH keys. The package both helps the user
    to setup a local git installation, and also provides a back-end for git/ssh client
    libraries to authenticate with existing user credentials.

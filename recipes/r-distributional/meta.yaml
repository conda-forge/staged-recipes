  summary: Vectorised distribution objects with tools for manipulating, visualising, and using
    probability distributions. Designed to allow model prediction outputs to return
    distributions rather than their parameters, allowing users to directly interact
    with predictive distributions in a data-oriented workflow. In addition to providing
    generic replacements for p/d/q/r functions, other useful statistics can be computed
    including means, variances, intervals, and highest density regions.

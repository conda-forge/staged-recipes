  summary: 'Optimized C library for ECDSA signatures and secret/public key operations on curve secp256k1.'
  description: |
    This library is intended to be the highest quality publicly available 
    library for cryptography on the secp256k1 curve. However, the primary 
    focus of its development has been for usage in the Bitcoin system and 
    usage unlike Bitcoin's may be less well tested, verified, or suffer 
    from a less well thought out interface. Correct usage requires some 
    care and consideration that the library is fit for your application's purpose.

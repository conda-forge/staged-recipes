  summary: 'Reference BLEU implementation that auto-downloads test sets and reports a version string to facilitate cross-lab comparisons'

  description: |
    SacreBLEU (Post, 2018) provides hassle-free computation of shareable,
    comparable, and reproducible BLEU scores. Inspired by Rico Sennrich's
    multi-bleu-detok.perl, it produces the official WMT scores but works with
    plain text. It also knows all the standard test sets and handles
    downloading, processing, and tokenization for you.

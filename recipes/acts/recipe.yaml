  summary: |
    ACTS is an experiment-independent toolkit for (charged) particle track
    reconstruction in (high energy) physics experiments implemented in modern
    C++.
  description: |
    The ACTS project provides high-level track reconstruction modules that can
    be used for any tracking detector.
    The tracking detector geometry description is optimized for efficient
    navigation and fast extrapolation of tracks.
    Converters for several common geometry description packages are available.
    In addition to the algorithmic code, this project also provides an event data
    model for the description of track parameters and measurements.

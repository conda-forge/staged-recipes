  summary: 'scs: splitting conic solver'
  description: |
    SCS (splitting conic solver) is a numerical optimization package for solving
    large-scale convex cone problems, based on our paper Conic Optimization via
    Operator Splitting and Homogeneous Self-Dual Embedding. It is written in C
    and can be used in other C, C++, Python, Matlab, R, Julia, Java, and Scala
    programs via included interfaces (Julia interface available here). It can
    also be called as a solver from convex optimization toolboxes CVX (3.0 or
    later), CVXPY, Convex.jl, and Yalmip.

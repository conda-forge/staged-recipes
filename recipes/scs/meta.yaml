  summary: 'C package that solves convex cone problems via operator splitting' 
  dev_url: https://github.com/cvxgrp/scs/ 
  description: |
    SCS (splitting conic solver) is a numerical optimization package for solving 
    large-scale convex cone problems, based on our paper Conic Optimization via 
    Operator Splitting and Homogeneous Self-Dual Embedding. It is written in C 
    and can be used in other C, C++, Python, Matlab, R, Julia, Java, and Scala 
    programs via included interfaces (Julia interface available here). 
    It can also be called as a solver from convex optimization toolboxes 
    CVX (3.0 or later), CVXPY, Convex.jl, and Yalmip.

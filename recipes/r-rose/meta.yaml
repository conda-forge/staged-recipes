  summary: The package provides functions to deal with binary classification problems in the
    presence of imbalanced classes. Synthetic balanced samples are generated according
    to ROSE (Menardi and Torelli, 2013). Functions that implement more traditional remedies
    to the class imbalance are also provided, as well as different metrics to evaluate
    a learner accuracy. These are estimated by holdout, bootstrap or cross-validation
    methods.

  summary: '''Elasticsearch'' is an open-source, distributed, document-based datastore (<https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch>).
    It provides an ''HTTP'' ''API'' for querying the database and extracting datasets,
    but that ''API'' was not designed for common data science workflows like pulling
    large batches of records and normalizing those documents into a data frame that
    can be used as a training dataset for statistical models. ''uptasticsearch'' provides
    an interface for ''Elasticsearch'' that is explicitly designed to make these data
    science workflows easy and fun.'

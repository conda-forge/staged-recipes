  summary: 'A C++ library for the efficient evaluation of integrals over effective core potentials.'
  description: |
    Libecpint is a C++ library for the efficient evaluation of integrals
    over ab initio effective core potentials, using a mixture of
    generated, recursive code and Gauss-Chebyshev quadrature. It is
    designed to be standalone and generic, and is now in its first stable
    release. If you experience any problems please raise an issue here;
    contributions and suggestions are also welcome.

  summary: 'Very basic terminfo library'
  description: |
    Unibilium is a very basic terminfo library. 
    It can read and write ncurses-style terminfo files, and it can interpret terminfo format strings. 
    It doesn't depend on curses or any other library. It also doesn't use global variables, so it should be thread-safe.

build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/meta.html#building-noarch-packages for more details.
  # noarch: python
  number: 0
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  script: python setup.py install --single-version-externally-managed --record record.txt

requirements:
  build:
    # if your project compiles code (such as a C extension) then add the required compilers as separate entries here.
    # compilers are named 'c', 'cxx' and 'fortran'.
    - python
    - setuptools
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - numba
    - future
    
  run:
    - python

test:
  # Some package might need a `test/commands` key to check CLI.
  # List all the packages/modules that `run_test.py` imports.

  description: |
    This module implements Geometric Algebras (a.k.a. Clifford algebras). Geometric Algebra (GA) is a universal algebra which subsumes complex algebra, quaternions, linear algebra and several other independent mathematical systems. Scalars, vectors, and higher-grade entities can be mixed freely and consistently in the form of mixed-grade multivectors.

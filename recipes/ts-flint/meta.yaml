  summary: A Time Series Library for Apache Spark
  description: |
    Flint is an open source library for Spark based around the TimeSeriesRDD,
    a time series aware data structure, and a collection of time series utility
    and analysis functions that use TimeSeriesRDDs. Unlike DataFrame and Dataset,
    Flint's TimeSeriesRDDs can leverage the existing ordering properties of datasets
    at rest and the fact that almost all data manipulations and analysis over these
    datasets respect their temporal ordering properties. It differs from other time
    series efforts in Spark in its ability to efficiently compute across panel data
    or on large scale high frequency data.

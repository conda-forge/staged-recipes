  summary: The stratification of univariate populations under stratified sampling designs is
    implemented according to Khan et al. (2002) <doi:10.1177/0008068320020518> and Khan
    et al. (2015) <doi:10.1080/02664763.2015.1018674> in this library. It determines
    the Optimum Strata Boundaries (OSB) and Optimum Sample Sizes (OSS) for the study
    variable, y, using the best-fit frequency distribution of a survey variable (if
    data is available) or a hypothetical distribution (if data is not available). The
    method formulates the problem of determining the OSB as mathematical programming
    problem which is solved by using a dynamic programming technique. If a dataset of
    the population is available to the surveyor, the method estimates its best-fit distribution
    and determines the OSB and OSS under Neyman allocation directly. When the dataset
    is not available, stratification is made based on the assumption that the values
    of the study variable, y, are available as hypothetical realizations of proxy values
    of y from recent surveys. Thus, it requires certain distributional assumptions about
    the study variable. At present, it handles stratification for the populations where
    the study variable follows a continuous distribution, namely, Pareto, Triangular,
    Right-triangular, Weibull, Gamma, Exponential, Uniform, Normal, Log-normal and Cauchy
    distributions.

  description: |
    'MMEngine is a foundational library for training deep learning models based on PyTorch. It provides a solid engineering foundation and frees developers from writing redundant codes on workflows. It serves as the training engine of all OpenMMLab codebases, which support hundreds of algorithms in various research areas. Moreover, MMEngine is also generic to be applied to non-OpenMMLab projects.'

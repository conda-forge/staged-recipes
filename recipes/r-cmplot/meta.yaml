  summary: 'Manhattan plot, a type of scatter plot, was widely used to display the association
    results. However, it is usually time-consuming and laborious for a non-specialist
    user to write scripts and adjust parameters of an elaborate plot. Moreover, the
    ever-growing traits measured have necessitated the integration of results from different
    Genome-wide association study researches. Circle Manhattan Plot is the first open
    R package that can lay out. Genome-wide association study P-value results in both
    traditional rectangular patterns, QQ-plot and novel circular ones. United in only
    one bull''s eye style plot, association results from multiple traits can be compared
    interactively, thereby to reveal both similarities and differences between signals.
    Additional functions include: highlight signals, a group of SNPs, chromosome visualization
    and candidate genes around SNPs.'

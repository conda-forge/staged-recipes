  summary: Type annotations for ScriptForge
  description: |
    This project is Type Support (typings) for LibreOffice ScriptForge
    At the time of writing, there is no PyPI packaging for ScriptForge.
    It is not necessary to have a ScriptForge package to take advantage of ScriptForge Typings.
    ScriptForge lives inside of LibreOffice. Using these typings in an modern development
    environment will give type support for the ScriptForge library.

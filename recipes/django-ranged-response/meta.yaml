  summary: 'Adds support for HTTP_RANGE requests in Django.'
  description: |
    If you're in the situation that you have an authenticated Django view
    that returns files for download, you may have noticed that Safari 9.x
    doesn't play audio files properly when returning audio-files. The
    reason is that Safari sends a HTTP_RANGE request header and expects a
    proper Content-Range response header in return. The original suggested
    fix applies the code to Django's static view. This is a packaged
    version of that fix, but uses a modified FileResponse, instead of
    applying it to Django's static view.

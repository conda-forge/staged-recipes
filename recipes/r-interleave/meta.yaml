  summary: Converts matrices and lists of matrices into a single vector by interleaving their
    values. That is, each element of the result vector is filled from the input matrices
    one row at a time. This is the same as transposing a matrix, then removing the dimension
    attribute, but is designed to operate on matrices in nested list structures.

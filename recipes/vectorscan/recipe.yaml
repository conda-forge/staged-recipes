about:
  summary: A portable fork of the high-performance regular expression matching library 
  description: |
    A fork of Intel's Hyperscan, modified to run on more platforms. Currently
    ARM NEON/ASIMD and Power VSX are 100% functional. ARM SVE2 support is in
    ongoing with access to hardware now. More platforms will follow in the
    future. Further more, starting 5.4.12 there is now a SIMDe port, which can
    be either used for platforms without official SIMD support, as SIMDe can
    emulate SIMD instructions, or as an alternative backend for existing
    architectures, for reference and comparison purposes.

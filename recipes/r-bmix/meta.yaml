  summary: "Binomial and Beta-Binomial mixture models for counts data."
  description: |
    BMix provides univariate Binomial and Beta-Binomial mixture models. 
    Count-based mixtures can be used in a variety of settings, for instance 
    to model genome sequencing data of somatic mutations in cancer. BMix fits 
    these mixtures by maximum likelihood exploiting the Expectation Maximization 
    algorithm. Model selection for the number of mixture components is by the 
    Integrated Classification Likelihood, an extension of the Bayesian Information 
    Criterion that includes the entropy of the latent variables.

  summary: Render R Markdown to Markdown (without using 'knitr'), and Markdown to lightweight
    HTML or 'LaTeX' documents with the 'commonmark' package (instead of 'Pandoc'). Some
    missing Markdown features in 'commonmark' are also supported, such as raw HTML or
    'LaTeX' blocks, 'LaTeX' math, superscripts, subscripts, footnotes, element attributes,
    and appendices, but not all 'Pandoc' Markdown features are (or will be) supported.
    With additional JavaScript and CSS, you can also create HTML slides and articles.
    This package can be viewed as a trimmed-down version of R Markdown and 'knitr'.
    It does not aim at rich Markdown features or a large variety of output formats (the
    primary formats are HTML and 'LaTeX'). Book and website projects of multiple input
    documents are also supported.

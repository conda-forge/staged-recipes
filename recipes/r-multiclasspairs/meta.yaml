  summary: 'A toolbox to train a single sample classifier that uses in-sample feature relationships.
    The relationships are represented as feature1 < feature2 (e.g. gene1 < gene2). We
    provide two options to go with. First is based on ''switchBox'' package which uses
    Top-score pairs algorithm. Second is a novel implementation based on random forest
    algorithm. For simple problems we recommend to use one-vs-rest using TSP option
    due to its simplicity and for being easy to interpret.  For complex problems RF
    performs better.  Both lines filter the features first then combine the filtered
    features to make the list of all the possible rules (i.e. rule1: feature1 < feature2,
    rule2: feature1 < feature3, etc...).  Then the list of rules will be filtered and
    the most important and informative rules will be kept. The informative rules will
    be assembled in an one-vs-rest model or in an RF model.  We provide a detailed description
    with each function in this package to explain the filtration and training methodology
    in each line.'

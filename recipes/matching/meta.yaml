  summary: 'A package for solving matching games.'
  description: |
    Matching games allow for the allocation of resources and partnerships 
    in a fair way. Typically, a matching game is defined by two sets of players 
    that each have preferences over at least some of the elements of the 
    other set. The objective of the game is then to find a mapping between the 
    sets of players in which everyone is happy enough with their match.

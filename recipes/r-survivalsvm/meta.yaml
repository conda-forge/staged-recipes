  summary: 'Performs support vectors analysis for data sets with survival outcome. Three approaches
    are available in the package: The regression approach takes censoring into account
    when formulating the inequality constraints of the support vector problem. In the
    ranking approach, the inequality constraints set the objective to maximize the concordance
    index for comparable pairs of observations. The hybrid approach combines the regression
    and ranking constraints in the same model.'

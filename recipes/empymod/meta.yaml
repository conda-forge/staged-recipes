  summary: "Open-source full 3D electromagnetic modeller for 1D VTI media"
  description: |
    The electromagnetic modeller empymod can model electric or magnetic
    responses due to a three-dimensional electric or magnetic source in a
    layered-earth model with vertical transverse isotropic (VTI) resistivity,
    VTI electric permittivity, and VTI magnetic permeability, from very low
    frequencies (DC) to very high frequencies (GPR). The calculation is carried
    out in the wavenumber-frequency domain, and various Hankel- and
    Fourier-transform methods are included to transform the responses into the
    space-frequency and space-time domains.

   summary: A fast K-mer counter for high-fidelity shotgun datasets

   description: |
     FastK is a kâ€‘mer counter that is optimized for processing high 
     quality DNA assembly data sets such as those produced with an 
     Illumina instrument or a PacBio run in HiFi mode. For example 
     it is about 2 times faster than KMC3 when counting 40-mers in a 
     50X HiFi data set. Its relative speedup decreases with increasing 
     error rate or increasing values of k, but regardless is a general 
     program that works for any DNA sequence data set and choice of k.

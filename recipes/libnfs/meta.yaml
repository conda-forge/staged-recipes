  summary: 'LIBNFS is a client library for accessing NFS shares over a network.'
  description: |
    LibNFS is a client library that implements the Network File System (NFS) 
    protocol, allowing applications to access files on remote NFS servers. 
    The library provides a complete NFS client implementation with support for
    NFSv3 and NFSv4 protocols, as well as related protocols such as MOUNT, 
    PORTMAP, NLM (Network Lock Manager), NSM (Network Status Monitor), and 
    RQUOTA.

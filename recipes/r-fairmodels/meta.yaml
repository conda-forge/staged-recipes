  summary: "Measure fairness metrics in one place for many models. Check how big is model's bias
    towards different races, sex, nationalities etc. Use measures such as Statistical
    Parity, Equal odds to detect the discrimination against unprivileged groups. Visualize
    the bias using heatmap, radar plot, biplot, bar chart (and more!). There are various
    pre-processing and post-processing bias mitigation algorithms implemented. Package
    also supports calculating fairness metrics for regression models. Find more details
    in (Wi\u015Bniewski, Biecek (2021)) <arXiv:2104.00507>."

  summary: 'A library and set of applications for fitting and generating multi-body particle decays.'
  description: |
    AmpGen is a library and set of applications for fitting and generating
    multi-body particle decays using the isobar model. It developed out of
    the MINT project used in the fitting of three and four-body pseudoscalar
    decays by the CLEO-c and LHCb colloborations. The library can handle the
    fitting and generation of a wide variety of final states, including those
    involving fermions and photons, as well as polarised initial states.
    
    Source code for the evaluation of amplitudes is dynamically generated by
    a custom engine, JIT compiled and dynamically linked to the user
    programme at runtime, which results in high flexibility and performance.

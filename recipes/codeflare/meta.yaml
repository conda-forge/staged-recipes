  description: |
    CodeFlare is a framework to simplify the integration, scaling and
     acceleration of complex multi-step analytics and machine learning
     pipelines on the cloud. One of its main features are: Pipeline execution
     and scaling: CodeFlare Pipelines faciltates the definition and parallel
     execution of pipelines. It unifies pipeline workflows across multiple
     frameworks while providing nearly optimal scale-out parallelism on
     pipelined computations. CodeFlare simplifies deployment and integration by
     enabling a serverless user experience with the integration with Red Hat
     OpenShift and IBM Cloud Code Engine and providing adapters and connectors
     to make it simple to load data and connect to data services.

  summary: The 'ggplot2' package provides a strong API for sequentially building up a plot, but
    does not concern itself with composition of multiple plots. 'patchwork' is a package
    that expands the API to allow for arbitrarily complex composition of plots by, among
    others, providing mathematical operators for combining multiple plots. Other packages
    that try to address this need (but with a different approach) are 'gridExtra' and
    'cowplot'.

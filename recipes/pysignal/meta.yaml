  summary: Python Signal Library to mimic the Qt Signal system for event driven connections

  description: |
    A Qt style signal implementation that doesn't require QObjects.
    This supports class methods, functions, lambdas and partials.

    Signals can either be created on the instance or on the class, and
    can be handled either as objects or by string name. Unlike PyQt
    signals, PySignals do not enforce types by default as I believe this
    is more pythonic.

  summary: 'Symmetry-related routines for cluster expansion and other codes that rely on symmetries of lattices and crystals.'
  description: |
    Symmetry-related routines for cluster expansion and other codes that rely on symmetries of lattices and crystals.
    This code was started by GLWH in 1999 with help from Harold Stokes (Mr. Isotropy, see iso.byu.edu). It now
    includes a number of numerical and combinatorial routines that have been useful in developing UNCLE (the Unversal
    CLuster Expansion code). The enum project also relies on this library.

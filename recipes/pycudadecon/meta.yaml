  summary: 'Python wrapper for cudaDecon - GPU accelerated 3D deconvolution for microscopy'
  description: |
    This package provides a python wrapper and convenience functions for cudaDeconv,
    which is a CUDA/C++ implementation of an accelerated Richardson Lucy Deconvolution algorithm,
    suitable for general applications,
    but designed particularly for stage-scanning light sheet applications such as Lattice Light Sheet.
    cudaDeconv was originally written by Lin Shao and modified by Dan Milkie,
    at Janelia Research campus.

  summary: >
    SVCROWS is a user-friendly program for categorizing structural variants.
  description: |
    Structural variants (SVs) are large rearrangements of the genome of an organism that are
    prevalent in critical organism phenotypes and human diseases. SVCROWS provides users with
    options to produce biologically meaningful variant calls based on reciprocal overlap
    dependent on SV size. It optionally uses breakpoint matching to further define similarity
    between SVs. These features make SVCROWS a versatile and malleable tool for SV analysis.

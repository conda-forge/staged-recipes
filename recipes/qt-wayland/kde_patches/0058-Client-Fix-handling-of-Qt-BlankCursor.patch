Subject: [PATCH 58/58] Client: Fix handling of Qt::BlankCursor

The cursor may not be properly set when a window has Qt::BlankCursor and
it's shown. In that case, the cursor surface may not be present and
wl_pointer.set_cursor won't be called.

On the other hand, wl_pointer.set_cursor must be always called when
wl_pointer.enter is received.

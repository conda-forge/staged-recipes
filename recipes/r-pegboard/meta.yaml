  summary: Parse Source Files in The Carpentries Workbench
  description: |
    The Carpentries (<https://carpentries.org>) curricula is made of of lessons that are
    hosted as websites. Each lesson represents between a half day to two days of instruction
    and contains several episodes, which are written as 'kramdown'-flavored 'markdown'
    documents and converted to HTML using the 'Jekyll' static website generator. This
    package builds on top of the 'tinkr' package; reads in these markdown documents
    to 'XML' and stores them in R6 classes for convenient exploration and manipulation
    of sections within episodes.

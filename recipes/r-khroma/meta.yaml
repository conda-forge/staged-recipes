  summary: 'Colour Schemes for Scientific Data Visualization'
  description: |
    Color schemes ready for each type of data (qualitative, diverging or 
    sequential), with colors that are distinct for all people, including 
    color-blind readers. This package provides an implementation of Paul 
    Tol (2018) and Fabio Crameri (2018) color schemes for use with 'graphics' 
    or 'ggplot2'. It provides tools to simulate color-blindness and to test 
    how well the colors of any palette are identifiable. Several scientific 
    thematic schemes (geologic timescale, land cover, FAO soils, etc.) are 
    also implemented.

  # sha256 is the preferred checksum -- you can get it for a file with:
  #  `openssl sha256 <file name>`.
  # You may need the openssl package, available on conda-forge:
  #  `conda install openssl -c conda-forge``

build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python for more details.
  # noarch: python
  number: 0
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  script: "{{ PYTHON }} -m pip install . -vv"

requirements:
  host:
    - perl

test:
  # Some packages might need a `test/commands` key to check CLI.
  # List all the packages/modules that `run_test.py` imports.
  commands:
    - perl tii.pl --test

  description: |
    tii is a tee-like program redirecting STDIN both to STDOUT and
    to a pastebin.com paste. STDOUT can be suppressed, and the strem
    can be also written to a file. Requires pastebin.com APIkey, either
    supplied via "-a" or saved in ~/.pastebin.

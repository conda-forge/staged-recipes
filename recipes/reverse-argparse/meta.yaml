about:
  description: |
    Whereas argparse is concerned with taking a bunch of command line arguments
    and parsing them, this package is intended to do the opposite; that is,
    it'll take the parsed arguments and create the effective command line
    invocation of the script that generated them.  The motivation is to be able
    to tell users exactly what was used for all of the options, taking into
    consideration any defaults and other transformations that might've been
    applied in the midst of parsing, such that users are able to reproduce a
    prior run of a script exactly.

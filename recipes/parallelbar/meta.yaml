  summary: Parallel processing with progress bars
  description: |
     Parallelbar displays the progress of tasks in the process pool for Pool class methods such as map, 
     starmap (since 1.2 version), imap and imap_unordered. 
     Parallelbar is based on the tqdm module and the standard python multiprocessing library. 
     Also, it is possible to handle exceptions that occur within a separate process, 
     as well as set a timeout for the execution of a task by a process.

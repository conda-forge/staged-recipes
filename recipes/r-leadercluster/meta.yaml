  summary: Leader Clustering Algorithm
  description: |
    The leader clustering algorithm provides a means for clustering a set of data
    points. Unlike many other clustering algorithms it does not require the user to
    specify the number of clusters, but instead requires the approximate radius of a
    cluster as its primary tuning parameter. The package provides a fast implementation 
    of this algorithm in n-dimensions using Lp-distances (with special cases for p=1,2, 
    and infinity) as well as for spatial data using the Haversine formula.

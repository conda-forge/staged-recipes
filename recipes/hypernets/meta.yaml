  summary: 'A General Automated Machine Learning framework.'
  description: |
    Hypernets is a general AutoML framework, based on which it can implement automatic
    optimization tools for various machine learning frameworks and libraries, including
    deep learning frameworks such as tensorflow, keras, pytorch, and machine learning
    libraries like sklearn, lightgbm, xgboost, etc.  We introduced an abstract search
    space representation, taking into account the requirements of hyperparameter
    optimization and neural architecture search(NAS), making Hypernets a general
    framework that can adapt to various automated machine learning needs.

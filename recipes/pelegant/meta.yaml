  description: |
    Elegant is an accelerator code that computes beta functions, matrices,
    orbits, floor coordinates, amplification factors, dynamic aperture, and
    more. It does 6-D tracking with matrices and/or canonical integrators, and
    supports a variety of time-dependent elements. It also does optimization
    (e.g., matching), including optimization of tracking results. It is the
    principle accelerator code used at APS.

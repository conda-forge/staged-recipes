      # As of May 2025, pip check fails because:
      # - mostlyai-qa 1.8.0 requires faiss-cpu, which is not installed.
      #   This seems to be false positive, possibly because `faiss` does not ship
      #   `dist-info` files on conda-forge.
      # - lightning 2.0.4 has requirement packaging<25.0,>=17.1, but you have packaging 25.0.
      #   This appears to be a problem with older builds of `lightning` on conda-forge,
      #   where dependencies were not pinned correctly. It's not clear why the solver
      #   decides to install these old builds rather than the newer ones (>2.10), where
      #   this problem is fixed. Experiment shows that the mostlyai-qa build is fine
      #   also using newer lightning builds.

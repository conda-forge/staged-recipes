  summary: 'Library for processing scanning transmission electron microscopy data acquired using a pixelated detector'
  description: |
    Python library for analysing pixelated scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) datasets.
    Pixelated STEM is using a 2D detector to image the convergent beam electron pattern generated by the electron beam after passing through a material.
    The library has implemented several common functions used with these types of datasets, like radial integration and center of mass.
    These are implemented as HyperSpy-type signals, where these new signals inherit various HyperSpy signal.

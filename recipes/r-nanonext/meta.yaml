  summary: R binding for NNG (Nanomsg Next Gen), a successor to ZeroMQ. NNG is a socket library
    implementing 'Scalability Protocols', a reliable, high-performance standard for
    common communications patterns including publish/subscribe, request/reply and service
    discovery, over in-process, IPC, TCP, WebSocket and secure TLS transports. As its
    own threaded concurrency framework, provides a toolkit for asynchronous programming
    and distributed computing, with intuitive 'aio' objects which resolve automatically
    upon completion of asynchronous operations, and synchronisation primitives allowing
    R to wait upon events signalled by concurrent threads.

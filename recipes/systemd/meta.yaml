  summary: 'The systemd System and Service Manager'
  description: |
    systemd is a suite of basic building blocks for a Linux system. It provides a
    system and service manager that runs as PID 1 and starts the rest of the system.
    systemd provides aggressive parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus
    activation for starting services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps
    track of processes using Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount
    points, and implements an elaborate transactional dependency-based service control
    logic.

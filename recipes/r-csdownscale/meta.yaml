  summary: Statistical downscaling and bias correction of climate predictions. It includes implementations
    of commonly used methods such as Analogs, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression,
    and Bias Correction techniques, as well as interpolation functions for regridding
    and point-based applications. It facilitates the production of high-resolution and
    local-scale climate information from coarse-scale predictions, which is essential
    for impact analyses. The package can be applied in a wide range of sectors and studies,
    including agriculture, water management, energy, heatwaves, and other climate-sensitive
    applications. The package was developed within the framework of the European Union
    Horizon Europe projects Impetus4Change (101081555) and ASPECT (101081460), the Wellcome
    Trust supported HARMONIZE project (224694/Z/21/Z), and the Spanish national project
    BOREAS (PID2022-140673OA-I00). Implements the methods described in Duzenli et al.
    (2024) <doi:10.5194/egusphere-egu24-19420>.

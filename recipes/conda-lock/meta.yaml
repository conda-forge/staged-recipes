  summary: Lightweight lockfile for conda environments
  description: |
    Conda lock is a lightweight library that can be used to generate fully
    reproducible lock files for conda environments.
    It does this by performing multiple solves for conda targeting a set of
    platforms you desire lockfiles for.
    This also has the added benefit of acting as an external presolve for conda
    as the lockfiles it generates results in the conda solver not being invoked
    when installing the packages from the generated lockfile.

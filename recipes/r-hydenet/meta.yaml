  summary: Facilities for easy implementation of hybrid Bayesian networks using R. Bayesian networks
    are directed acyclic graphs representing joint probability distributions, where
    each node represents a random variable and each edge represents conditionality.
    The full joint distribution is therefore factorized as a product of conditional
    densities, where each node is assumed to be independent of its non-descendents given
    information on its parent nodes. Since exact, closed-form algorithms are computationally
    burdensome for inference within hybrid networks that contain a combination of continuous
    and discrete nodes, particle-based approximation techniques like Markov Chain Monte
    Carlo are popular. We provide a user-friendly interface to constructing these networks
    and running inference using the 'rjags' package. Econometric analyses (maximum expected
    utility under competing policies, value of information) involving decision and utility
    nodes are also supported.

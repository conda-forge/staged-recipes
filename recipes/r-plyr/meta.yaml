  summary: 'A set of tools that solves a common set of problems: you need to
    breaka big problem down into manageable pieces, operate on each piece and
    then put all the pieces back together.  For example, you might want to fit
    a model to each spatial location or time point in your study, summarise
    data by panels or collapse high-dimensional arrays to simpler summary
    statistics. The development of ''plyr'' has been generously supported
    by ''Becton Dickinson''.'

  summary: "Advanced 6-DOF trajectory simulation for High-Power Rocketry."
  description: |
    RocketPy is a trajectory simulation for High-Power Rocketry built by
    Projeto Jupiter. The code is written as a Python library and allows
    for a complete 6 degrees of freedom simulation of a rocket's flight
    trajectory, including high fidelity variable mass effects as well as
    descent under parachutes. Weather conditions, such as wind profile,
    can be imported from sophisticated datasets, allowing for realistic
    scenarios. Furthermore, the implementation facilitates complex simulations,
    such as multi-stage rockets, design and trajectory optimization and
    dispersion analysis.

  summary: 'Minimum Supported Dependencies'
  description: |
    This package helps packagers implement SPEC-0000 as a means to drop minimum
    supported dependencies.

    It is designed in a way that is Opt-in for packagers and not globally defined
    accross all of conda-forge.

    Add it to your run requirements, and it will export minimum versions for all
    packages that are listed as core dependencies.

    Once a new version of this package is released, make a PR to update the global
    pin in https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/

    One may override the "time bound" by simply pinning the spec0 package to the desired
    version for their pckage. However, we strongly encourage packagers to simply use
    the latest version of this package.

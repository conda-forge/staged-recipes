  description: |
    Shillelagh (pronounced ʃɪˈleɪlɪ) is an implementation of the Python DB
     API 2.0 based on SQLite (using the APSW library), it includes an SQLAlchemy
     dialect as well as a command-line utility. Shillelagh allows you to easily
     query non-SQL resources. For example, if you have a Google Spreadsheet you
     can query it directly as if it were a table in a database. Currently
     Shillelagh has the following adapters: Google Spreadsheets; WeatherAPI;
     Socrata Open Data API, and CSV files.

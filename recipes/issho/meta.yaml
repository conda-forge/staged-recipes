  description: |
    issho and intuitive wrapper over paramiko for configuring and talking to a remote host. 
    keyring is used to manage secrets locally.
    issho is designed such that interacting with a single, heavily used remote machine 
    should be easy, and working with more than one remote machine should be simple.

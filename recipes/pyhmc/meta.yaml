  description: |
      This package is a straight-forward port of the functions hmc2.m and
      hmc2_opt.m from the MCMCstuff matlab toolbox written by Aki Vehtari. The
      code is originally based on the functions hmc.m from the netlab toolbox
      written by Ian T Nabney. The portion of algorithm involving "windows" is
      derived from the C code for this function included in the Software for
      Flexible Bayesian Modeling written by Radford Neal.

      The original Python port was made by Kilian Koepsell, and subsequently
      modernized by Robert T. McGibbon.

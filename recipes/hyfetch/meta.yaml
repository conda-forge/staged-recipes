  summary: Command-line tool that presents system info with LGBTQ+ pride flags
  description: >
    HyFetch is a command line script to display information about your Linux system, 
    such as amount of installed packages, OS and kernel version, active GTK theme, 
    CPU info, and used/available memory. It is a fork of neofetch, and adds pride flag 
    coloration to the OS logo.

    Hyfetch also has the ability to integrate with other system info tools, such as 
    fastfetch, to use them to gather info that is then displayed through hyfetch.

  summary: GPU accelerated agent based modelling framework for Python
  description: |
    FLAME GPU is a GPU accelerated simulator for domain independent complex systems simulations. Version 2 brings a complete re-write of the existing library offering greater flexibility, an improved interface for agent scripting, CUDA C++ & python3 interfaces and better research software engineering.
    FLAME GPU provides a mapping between a formal agent specifications with C based scripting and optimised CUDA code. This includes a number of key ABM building blocks such as multiple agent types, agent communication and birth and death allocation.

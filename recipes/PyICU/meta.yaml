build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/meta.html#building-noarch-packages for more details.
  # noarch: python
  number: 0
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  script: python -m pip install --no-deps --ignore-installed .

requirements:
  build:
    - python
    - pip
    # if your project compiles code (such as a C extension) then add `toolchain` as a build requirement.
  run:
    - python

test:
  # Some package might need a `test/commands` key to check CLI.
  # List all the packages/modules that `run_test.py` imports.

    Welcome to PyICU, a Python extension wrapping the ICU C++ libraries.
    ICU stands for "International Components for Unicode". These are the i18n
    libraries of the Unicode Consortium. They implement much of the Unicode Standard,
    many of its companion Unicode Technical Standards, and much of Unicode CLDR.

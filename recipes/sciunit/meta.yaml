  summary: 'A framework for validating scientific models by creating experimental-data-driven unit tests.'

  description: |
    Everyone hopes that their model has some correspondence with reality. 
    Usually, checking whether this is true is done informally. 
    But SciUnit makes this formal and transparent. SciUnit is a framework for validating 
    scientific models by creating experimental-data-driven unit tests.

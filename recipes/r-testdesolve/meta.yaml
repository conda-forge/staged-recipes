  summary: Functions that solve initial value problems of a system of first-order ordinary differential
    equations ('ODE'), of partial differential equations ('PDE'), of differential algebraic
    equations ('DAE'), and of delay differential equations.  The functions provide an
    interface to the FORTRAN functions 'lsoda', 'lsodar', 'lsode', 'lsodes' of the 'ODEPACK'
    collection, to the FORTRAN functions 'dvode', 'zvode' and 'daspk' and a C-implementation
    of solvers of the 'Runge-Kutta' family with fixed or variable time steps.  The package
    contains routines designed for solving 'ODEs' resulting from 1-D, 2-D and 3-D partial
    differential equations ('PDE') that have been converted to 'ODEs' by numerical differencing.

  summary: A Python AutoML tool for fast exploration and experimentation of supervised machine learning pipelines.
  description: |
    There is no magic formula in data science that can tell us which type of machine
    learning algorithm will perform best for a specific use-case. Different models
    are better suited for different types of data and different problems. At best,
    you can follow some rough guide on how to approach problems with regard to which
    model to try on your data, but these are often more confusing than helpful. Best
    practices tell us to start with a simple model (e.g. linear regression) and build
    up to more complicated models (e.g. logistic regression -> random forest ->
    multilayer perceptron) if you are not satisfied with the results. Unfortunately,
    different models require different data cleaning steps, different type/amount of
    features, tuning a new set of hyperparameters, etc. Refactoring the code for this
    purpose can be quite boring and time consuming. Because of this, many data
    scientists end up just using the model best known to them and fine-tuning this
    particular model without ever trying different ones. This can result in poor
    performance (because the model is just not the right one for the task) or in poor
    time management (because you could have achieved a similar performance with a
    simpler/faster model).

    ATOM is here to help us solve these issues. With just a few lines of code, you
    can perform basic data cleaning steps, select relevant features and compare the
    performance of multiple models on a given dataset. ATOM should be able to provide
    quick insights on which algorithms perform best for the task at hand and provide
    an indication of the feasibility of the ML solution.

    It is important to realize that ATOM is not here to replace all the work a data
    scientist has to do before getting his model into production. ATOM doesn't spit
    out production-ready models just by tuning some parameters in its API. After
    helping you to determine the right model, you will most probably need to fine-tune
    it using use-case specific features and data cleaning steps in order to achieve
    maximum performance.

    So, this sounds a bit like AutoML, how is ATOM different than auto-sklearn or
    TPOT? Well, ATOM does AutoML in the sense that it helps you find the best model
    for a specific task, but contrary to the aforementioned packages, it does not
    actively search for the best model. It simply runs all of them and let you pick
    the one that you think suites you best. AutoML packages are often black boxes: if
    you provide data, it will magically return a working model. Although it works
    great, they often produce complicated pipelines with low explainability, hard to
    sell to the business. In this, ATOM excels. Every step of the pipeline is
    accounted for, and using the provided plotting methods, it’s easy to demonstrate
    why a model is better/worse than the other.

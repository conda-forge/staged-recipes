% LICENSING CONDITIONS FOR THE PSYCHTOOLBOX-3 DISTRIBUTION:
% ---------------------------------------------------------
%
% Psychtoolbox-3 is a distribution of a combination of many different
% materials.
%
% Different components in the distribution are contributed by different
% individuals or companies and provided to you under different licenses and
% terms of use.
%
% In a nutshell:
% --------------
%
% *All* of the material in the distribution is free for you to use, free of
% charge, for non-commercial, personal or research use in accordance with
% its license.
%
% *Almost all* of the material, with a few exceptions, is so called
% free and open-source software (FOSS), according to the OSI definition of
% Open Source (www.opensource.org), licensed to you under a OSI approved
% open-source and/or free-software license. Therefore, for most material
% you are also allowed to use, modify, merge with other software,
% sub-license, create derivative works of, and distribute the material, for
% commercial or non-commercial purposes, as long as you abide to the
% licensing conditions and terms of use of the licenses associated with the
% different materials.
%
% The subset of material which may only be used freely for non-commercial
% purposes, but is not neccessarily covered by a free software or open
% source license, can be found in the Psychtoolbox/PsychContributed
% subfolder. Each component is associated with some sort of a license or
% terms of use.
%
% All material outside that folder is licensed under some free-software or
% open-source software license.
%
% You can find the full, legally binding text of most of the used licenses
% in the appendix of this text file. If a license text is missing, please
% report this omission to us and meanwhile look up the definition of the
% license at http://www.opensource.org.
%
% The following non-exhaustive list (see below) describes which submodules
% and materials in the distribution are covered by which licenses. If some
% material isn't listed here, then a license or copyright may be attached
% to, or mentioned in the material or its accompanying documentation
% itself, e.g., in the source code of a M-File, script, GLSL shader file or
% C programming language file. If material doesn't come with any individual
% license or copyright attached and it isn't listed here, you can assume it
% is licensed to you under terms of the following very permissive MIT
% open-source license, with the following copyright:

%
% List of submodules with their associated licenses, as far as they deviate
% from the MIT license printed above, and their main authors:
%
% Psychtoolbox/PsychSound: portaudio_x64.dll
%
% The PsychPortAudio driver on Microsoft Windows dynamically loads
% a DLL, the "portaudio_x64.dll" from the Psychtoolbox/PsychSound/ subfolder.
% The PsychPortAudio driver on macOS statically links against libportaudio_osx_64.a,
% whereas the driver on Linux dynamically links against system-provided versions of
% libportaudio.so.
% The Windows DLL and macOS static library are compiled from the open-source MIT
% licensed PortAudio library from http://portaudio.com - The specific license text is
% included below in the licenses section.
%
% Older versions of Psychtoolbox (v3.0.14 and earlier) used a modified version
% of PortAudio and DLL's, static and dynamic libraries built from it. For documentation
% purposes and until further notice, the source code of this MIT licensed library and of
% all modifications we made can be found in a Psychtoolbox C-Sourcecode download in
% the subfolder PsychSourceGL/Cohorts/PortAudio/. Building from this source code would
% yield the old libraries for older < v3.0.15 Psychtoolbox versions. We may delete this
% source code soon, as it mostly does not serve any use anymore in Psychtoolbox 3.0.15
% and later.
%
%
% Psychtoolbox/PsychContributed: See individual licenses and output of
%                                "help PsychContributed" in that folder.
%
% Psychtoolbox/PsychHardware/LinuxDrivers/ modified versions of Linux device
% drivers, currently XOrg video drivers (DDX modules). These have their own
% licenses attached as part of their source code or Readme files. But usually
% some form of the MIT/X11 license. Check the sources for details.
%
% The tcp_udp_ip toolbox under Psychtoolbox/PsychHardware/iViewXToolbox/tcp_udp_ip/
% is Copyright Peter Rydesaeter et al., 1998-2003. Licensed under GPL v2 and

% The LGPL-2.1 license:
%
%                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
%                        Version 2.1, February 1999
%
%  Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin
%  Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301  USA Everyone is permitted
%  to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but
%  changing it is not allowed.
%
% [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
%  as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the
%  version number 2.1.]
%
%                             Preamble
%
%   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
% freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
% Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
% software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
%
%   This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
% specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free
% Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use
% it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this
% license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
% use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
%
%   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
% not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
% you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
% for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it
% if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in
% new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
% things.
%
%   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
% distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
% rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you
% if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
%
%   For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
% or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
% you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
% code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide complete
% object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the
% library after making changes to the library and recompiling it.  And you
% must show them these terms so they know their rights.
%
%   We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
% library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
% permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
%
%   To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
% there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
% modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know that
% what they have is not the original version, so that the original author's
% reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by
% others.
% 
%   Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
% any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively
% restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license
% from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that any patent license
% obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full
% freedom of use specified in this license.
%
%   Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
% ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
% General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is
% quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use this
% license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries
% into non-free programs.
%
%   When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
% a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
% combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
% General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the entire
% combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General Public
% License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with the
% library.
%
%   We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
% does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public
% License.  It also provides other free software developers Less of an
% advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages are the
% reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.
% However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special
% circumstances.
%
%   For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
% encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it
% becomes a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
% allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free library
% does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this case, there
% is little to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so
% we use the Lesser General Public License.
%
%   In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
% programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
% software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
% programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system,
% as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
%
%   Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
% users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked
% with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program
% using a modified version of the Library.
%
%   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
% modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
% "work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
% former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be
% combined with the library in order to run.
% 
%                   GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
%    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
%
%   0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
% program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
% authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
% Lesser General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee
% is addressed as "you".
%
%   A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
% prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which
% use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
%
%   The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
% which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
% Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright
% law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it,
% either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly
% into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without
% limitation in the term "modification".)
%
%   "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
% making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
% all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
% interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
% and installation of the library.
%
%   Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
% covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running
% a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a
% program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
% Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).
% Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the
% program that uses the Library does.
%
%   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
% complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
% conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
% copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices
% that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and
% distribute a copy of this License along with the Library.
%
%   You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
% and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
% fee.
% 
%   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
% of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute
% such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided
% that you also meet all of these conditions:
%
%     a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
%
%     b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
%     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
%
%     c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge
%     to all third parties under the terms of this License.
%
%     d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
%     table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the
%     facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is
%     invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in
%     the event an application does not supply such function or table, the
%     facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose
%     remains meaningful.
%
%     (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
%     purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.
%     Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied
%     function or table used by this function must be optional: if the
%     application does not supply it, the square root function must still
%     compute square roots.)
%
% These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
% identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and
% can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
% themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
% sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
% distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on
% the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this
% License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
% whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
%
% Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
% your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
% exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
% collective works based on the Library.
%
% In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
% with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
% storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the
% scope of this License.
%
%   3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
% License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
% this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that
% they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead
% of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary
% GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that
% version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in these
% notices.
% 
%   Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
% that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
% subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
%
%   This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
% the Library into a program that is not a library.
%
%   4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
% derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
% under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it
% with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must
% be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
% customarily used for software interchange.
%
%   If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
% from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
% source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute
% the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the
% source along with the object code.
%
%   5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
% Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
% linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a work,
% in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore
% falls outside the scope of this License.
%
%   However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
% creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
% contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
% library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6
% states terms for distribution of such executables.
%
%   When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
% that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
% derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
% Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked
% without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The threshold
% for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
%
%   If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
% structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
% functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file
% is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work.
% (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library
% will still fall under Section 6.)
%
%   Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
% distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any
% executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or
% not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
% 
%   6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
% link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work
% containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms
% of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work
% for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such
% modifications.
%
%   You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
% Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
% this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
% during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
% copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
% directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one of
% these things:
%
%     a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
%     machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
%     changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
%     Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
%     with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that uses
%     the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can
%     modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable
%     containing the modified Library.  (It is understood that the user who
%     changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not
%     necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified
%     definitions.)
%
%     b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
%     Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
%     copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
%     rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
%     will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the
%     user installs one, as long as the modified version is
%     interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
%
%     c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
%     years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection
%     6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this
%     distribution.
%
%     d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
%     from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
%     specified materials from the same place.
%
%     e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
%     materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
%
%   For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
% Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
% reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception, the
% materials to be distributed need not include anything that is normally
% distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components
% (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
% executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.
%
%   It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
% restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
% accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
% use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
% distribute.
% 
%   7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
% Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
% facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
% library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the
% Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and
% provided that you do these two things:
%
%     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
%     on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities.  This
%     must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
%
%     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that
%     part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to
%     find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
%
%   8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
% the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
% otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
% Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
% License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you
% under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as
% such parties remain in full compliance.
%
%   9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
% signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
% distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
% prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
% modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library),
% you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms
% and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or
% works based on it.
%
%   10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
% Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
% original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
% subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
% restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
% You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
% this License.
% 
%   11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
% infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
% conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
% otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
% excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute
% so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and
% any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not
% distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent license would
% not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who
% receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you
% could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from
% distribution of the Library.
%
% If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
% particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
% and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
%
% It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
% patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
% claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of
% the free software distribution system which is implemented by public
% license practices.  Many people have made generous contributions to the
% wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on
% consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to
% decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other
% system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
%
% This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
% a consequence of the rest of this License.
%
%   12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
% certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
% original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may
% add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those
% countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries
% not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the
% limitation as if written in the body of this License.
%
%   13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
% versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
% versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ
% in detail to address new problems or concerns.
%
% Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
% specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
% later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
% either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
% Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a license version
% number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
% Foundation.
% 
%   14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
% programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write
% to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
% by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation;
% we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by
% the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our
% free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software
% generally.
%
%                             NO WARRANTY
%
%   15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
% WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
% EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
% OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
% EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED
% WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE
% ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.
% SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
% SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
%
%   16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
% WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
% AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR
% DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
% DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING
% BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
% LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO
% OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS
% BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
%
%                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
% 
%            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
%
%   If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
% possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
% everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
% redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of
% the ordinary General Public License).
%
%   To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It
%   is
% safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most
% effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have
% at least the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is
% found.
%
%     <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it
%     does.> Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
%
%     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
%     it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as
%     published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the
%     License, or (at your option) any later version.
%
%     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
%     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
%     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
%     Lesser General Public License for more details.
%
%     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
%     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
%     Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA
%     02110-1301  USA
%
% Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
%
% You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
% school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
% necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
%
%   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library

%
% 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
% 		       Version 2, June 1991
%
%  Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
%                        59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
%  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
%  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
%
% 			    Preamble
%
%   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
% freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
% License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
% software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
% General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
% Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
% using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
% the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
% your programs, too.
%
%   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
% price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
% have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
% this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
% if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
% in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
%
%   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
% anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
% These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
% distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
%
%   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
% gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
% you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
% source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
% rights.
%
%   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
% (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
% distribute and/or modify the software.
%
%   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
% that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
% software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
% want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
% that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
% authors' reputations.
%
%   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
% patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
% program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
% program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
% patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
%
%   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
% modification follow.
% 
% 		    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
%    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
%
%   0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
% a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
% under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program", below,
% refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on the Program"
% means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
% that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
% either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
% language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
% the term "modification".)  Each licensee is addressed as "you".
%
% Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
% covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
% running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
% is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
% Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
% Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
%
%   1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
% source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
% conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
% copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
% notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
% and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
% along with the Program.
%
% You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
% you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
%
%   2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
% of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
% distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
% above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
%
%     a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
%     stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
%
%     b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
%     whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
%     part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
%     parties under the terms of this License.
%
%     c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
%     when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
%     interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
%     announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
%     notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
%     a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
%     these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
%     License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
%     does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
%     the Program is not required to print an announcement.)
% 
% These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
% identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
% and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
% themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
% sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
% distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
% on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
% this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
% entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
%
% Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
% your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
% exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
% collective works based on the Program.
%
% In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
% with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
% a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
% the scope of this License.
%
%   3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
% under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
% Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
%
%     a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
%     source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
%     1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
%
%     b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
%     years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
%     cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
%     machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
%     distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
%     customarily used for software interchange; or,
%
%     c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
%     to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
%     allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
%     received the program in object code or executable form with such
%     an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
%
% The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
% making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
% code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
% associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
% control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
% special exception, the source code distributed need not include
% anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
% form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
% operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
% itself accompanies the executable.
%
% If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
% access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
% access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
% distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
% compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
% 
%   4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
% except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
% otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
% void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
% However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
% this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
% parties remain in full compliance.
%
%   5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
% signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
% distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
% prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
% modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
% Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
% all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
% the Program or works based on it.
%
%   6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
% Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
% original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
% these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
% restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
% You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
% this License.
%
%   7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
% infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
% conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
% otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
% excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
% distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
% License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
% may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
% license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
% all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
% the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
% refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
%
% If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
% any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
% apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
% circumstances.
%
% It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
% patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
% such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
% integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
% implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
% generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
% through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
% system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
% to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
% impose that choice.
%
% This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
% be a consequence of the rest of this License.
% 
%   8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
% certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
% original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
% may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
% those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
% countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
% the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
%
%   9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
% of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
% be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
% address new problems or concerns.
%
% Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
% specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any
% later version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions
% either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
% Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
% this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
% Foundation.
%
%   10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
% programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
% to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
% Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
% make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
% of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
% of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
%
% 			    NO WARRANTY
%
%   11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
% FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
% OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
% PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
% OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
% MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
% TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
% PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
% REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
%
%   12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
% WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
% REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
% INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
% OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
% TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
% YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
% PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
% POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

% 
% 	    How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
%
%   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
% possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
% free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
%
%   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
% to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
% convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
% the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
%
%     <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
%     Copyright (C) 19yy  <name of author>
%
%     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
%     it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
%     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
%     (at your option) any later version.
%
%     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
%     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
%     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
%     GNU General Public License for more details.
%
%     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
%     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
%     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
%
%
% Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
%
% If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
% when it starts in an interactive mode:
%
%     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19yy name of author
%     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
%     This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
%     under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
%
% The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
% parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
% be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
% mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
%
% You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
% school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
% necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
%
%   Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
%   `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
%
%   <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
%   Ty Coon, President of Vice
%
% This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
% proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
% consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
% library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
% Public License instead of this License.

  summary: >
    Kokkos Kernels is a software library of linear algebra and graph algorithms used across many HPC applications to 
    achieve best (not just good) performance on every architecture.
  description: >
    The baseline version of this library is written using 
    the Kokkos Core programming model for portability and good performance. The library has architecture-specific 
    optimizations or uses vendor-specific versions of these mathematical algorithms where needed. This reduces the amount 
    of architecture-specific software that an application team potentially needs to develop, thus further reducing their  
    (modification cost)to achieve “best in class” performance.

  summary: Functions to implement model selection and multimodel inference based on Akaike's
    information criterion (AIC) and the second-order AIC (AICc), as well as their quasi-likelihood
    counterparts (QAIC, QAICc) from various model object classes.  The package implements
    classic model averaging for a given parameter of interest or predicted values, as
    well as a shrinkage version of model averaging parameter estimates or effect sizes.  The
    package includes diagnostics and goodness-of-fit statistics for certain model types
    including those of 'unmarkedFit' classes estimating demographic parameters after
    accounting for imperfect detection probabilities.  Some functions also allow the
    creation of model selection tables for Bayesian models of the 'bugs', 'rjags', and
    'jagsUI' classes.  Functions also implement model selection using BIC.  Objects
    following model selection and multimodel inference can be formatted to LaTeX using
    'xtable' methods included in the package.

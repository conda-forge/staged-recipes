  summary: R implementation of generalized survival models (GSMs), smooth accelerated failure
    time (AFT) models and Markov multi-state models. For the GSMs, g(S(t|x))=eta(t,x)
    for a link function g, survival S at time t with covariates x and a linear predictor
    eta(t,x). The main assumption is that the time effect(s) are smooth <doi:10.1177/0962280216664760>.
    For fully parametric models with natural splines, this re-implements Stata's 'stpm2'
    function, which are flexible parametric survival models developed by Royston and
    colleagues. We have extended the parametric models to include any smooth parametric
    smoothers for time. We have also extended the model to include any smooth penalized
    smoothers from the 'mgcv' package, using penalized likelihood. These models include
    left truncation, right censoring, interval censoring, gamma frailties and normal
    random effects <doi:10.1002/sim.7451>. For the smooth AFTs, S(t|x) = S_0(t*eta(t,x)),
    where the baseline survival function S_0(t)=exp(-exp(eta_0(t))) is modelled for
    natural splines for eta_0, and the time-dependent cumulative acceleration factor
    eta(t,x)=\int_0^t exp(eta_1(u,x)) du for log acceleration factor eta_1(u,x). The
    Markov multi-state models allow for a range of models with smooth transitions to
    predict transition probabilities, length of stay, utilities and costs, with differences,
    ratios and standardisation.

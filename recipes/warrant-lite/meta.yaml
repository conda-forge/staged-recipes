  summary: |
    Small Python library for process SRP requests for AWS Cognito. This library was
    initially included in the [Warrant](https://www.github.com/capless/warrant) library.
    We decided to separate it because not all projects and workfows need all of the
    helper classes and functions in Warrant.

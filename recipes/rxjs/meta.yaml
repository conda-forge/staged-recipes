  summary: 'A reactive programming library for JavaScript'
  description: |
    Reactive Extensions Library for JavaScript. This is a rewrite of Reactive-Extensions/RxJS 
    and is the latest production-ready version of RxJS. This rewrite is meant to have better 
    performance, better modularity, better debuggable call stacks, while staying mostly backwards 
    compatible, with some breaking changes that reduce the API surface.

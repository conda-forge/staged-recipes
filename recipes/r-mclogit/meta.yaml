  summary: Provides estimators for multinomial logit models in their conditional logit and baseline
    logit variants, with or without random effects, with or without overdispersion.
    Random effects models are estimated using the PQL technique (based on a Laplace
    approximation) or the MQL technique (based on a Solomon-Cox approximation). Estimates
    should be treated with caution if the group sizes are small.

  summary: It is often useful when developing an R package to track the relationship between
    functions in order to appropriately test and track changes. This package generates
    a graph of the relationship between all R functions in a package. It can also be
    used on any directory containing .R files which can be very useful for 'shiny' apps
    or other non-package workflows.

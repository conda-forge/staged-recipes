# The original CRAN metadata for this package was:

# Package: RcppCCTZ
# Type: Package
# Title: 'Rcpp' Bindings for the 'CCTZ' Library

# Description: 'Rcpp' Access to the 'CCTZ' timezone library is provided. 'CCTZ' is a C++ library for translating between absolute and civil times using the rules of a time zone.

# License: GPL (>= 2)
# Imports: Rcpp (>= 0.11.0)
# Suggests: tinytest
# LinkingTo: Rcpp
# SystemRequirements: A 64-bit POSIX OS such as Linux or OS X with IANA time zone data in /usr/share/zoneinfo as well as a recent-enough C++11 compiler (such as g++-4.9 or later which is preferred, g++-4.8 works too). On Windows the zoneinfo included with R is used; and time parsing support is enabled via a backport of std::get_time from the LLVM libc++ library.

    What's in the oven?
    - A Bakefile, which looks and feels like the good parts of a Makefile.
    - Except, you can write real bash code! Any and all syntax is accepted — no magic going on here. ;)
    - Unlike Makefile, you may utilize (4 × U+0020 a.k.a. “spaces”) for indentation.
    - Environment variables are explicitly passed or whitelisted (--allow), not inherited from the parent shell.
    - Tasks can be run safely and reliably. Rest assured that scripts are executed from the project root directory.
    - There are many other benefits to this design, that have yet to be expressed in this document.

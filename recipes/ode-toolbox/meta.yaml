  summary: 'ODE-toolbox: Automatic selection and generation of integration schemes' 
  description: |
    Automatic selection and generation of integration schemes for systems of 
    ordinary differential equations.
    Choosing the optimal solver for systems of ordinary differential 
    equations (ODEs) is a critical step in dynamical systems simulation. 
    ODE-toolbox is a Python package that assists in solver benchmarking, 
    and recommends solvers on the basis of a set of user-configurable 
    heuristics. For all dynamical equations that admit an analytic solution, 
    ODE-toolbox generates propagator matrices that allow the solution to be 
    calculated at machine precision. For all others, first-order update 
    expressions are returned based on the Jacobian matrix.

  summary: 'Efficient binary-decimal and decimal-binary conversion routines for IEEE doubles.'

  description: |
    double-conversion provides binary-decimal and decimal-binary routines for IEEE doubles.
    The library consists of efficient conversion routines that have been extracted from 
    the V8 JavaScript engine. The code has been refactored and improved so that it can be 
    used more easily in other projects.

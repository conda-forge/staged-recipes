  summary: 'This tool, called verifycurves, takes input models that consist of closed-loop curves, and outputs a topology certificate as a .txt file. It is based on [Qu and James 2021]. Among the different linking-number computation methods described in [Qu and James 2021], this tool supports using Barnesâ€“Hut or direct summation to evaluate the Gauss linking integral.'

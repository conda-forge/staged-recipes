  summary: 'Cross platform GUI toolkit for Python, Phoenix verison (alt. UNOFFICIAL build)'

  description: |
    wxPython's Project Phoenix: Cross platform GUI toolkit for Python.
    A new implementation of wxPython, better, stronger, faster than he
    was before. Just like 'Classic' wxPython, is
    a GUI toolkit for Python that is a wrapper around the wxWidgets C++
    GUI library. wxPython provides a large variety of window types and 
    controls, all implemented with a native look and feel (by using the
    native widgets) on the platforms upon which it is supported.

    summary: The 'Rcpp' package provides R functions as well as C++ classes which
        offer a seamless integration of R and C++. Many R data types and objects can
        be mapped back and forth to C++ equivalents which facilitates both writing
        of new code as well as easier integration of third-party libraries. Documentation  about
        'Rcpp' is provided by several vignettes included in this package, via the  'Rcpp
        Gallery' site at <http://gallery.rcpp.org>, the paper by Eddelbuettel and  Francois
        (2011, JSS), and the book by Eddelbuettel (2013, Springer); see  'citation("Rcpp")'
        for details on these last two.

  summary: 'robust, optimal, and maintainable programming language'

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    Zig is an open-source programming language designed for robustness, optimality, and clarity.

    Robust - behavior is correct even for edge cases such as out of memory.
    Optimal - write programs the best way they can behave and perform.
    Clear - precisely communicate your intent to the compiler and other programmers.
    The language imposes a low overhead to reading code.

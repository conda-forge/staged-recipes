  summary: CLI of specialized path finding algorithms related to adjacency/proximity
  description: |
    The command-line tool supports three main modes:
    • Road Segmentation Mode: Determines which service points (e.g., hydrants) are closest to each road segment using network distance, and optionally splits roads into discrete distance categories for service area analysis.
    • Neighboring Points Mode: Identifies the nearest neighboring service points along a road network in each direction, calculating spacing distances between facilities like hydrants for regulatory compliance assessment.
    • Structure Access Mode: Computes shortest unobstructed paths from building corners to road networks, finding the least accessible points on buildings for emergency response planning and fire code compliance.

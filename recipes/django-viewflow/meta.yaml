  summary: 'Reusable workflow library for Django'
  description: |
    Viewflow takes the best parts from two worlds. It is based on BPMN - 
    business process modeling and notation standard - and plays well with the 
    django web development toolchain. BPMN provides a standard notation, 
    readily understandable by all business stakeholders. Viewflow bridges 
    the gap between a picture and an executable, ready to use web application.

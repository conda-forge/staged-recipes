  description: |
    Folly (acronymed loosely after Facebook Open Source Library) is a library of C++11 components 
    designed with practicality and efficiency in mind. Folly contains a variety of core library 
    components used extensively at Facebook. In particular, it's often a dependency of Facebook's 
    other open source C++ efforts and place where those projects can share code.

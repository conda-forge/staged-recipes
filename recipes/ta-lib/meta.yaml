  summary: 'Cython-based Python wrapper for the TA-LIB C library'
  description: |
    The original Python bindings included with TA-Lib use SWIG which unfortunately are difficult to install and aren't as efficient as they could be. Therefore this project uses Cython and Numpy to efficiently and cleanly bind to TA-Lib -- producing results 2-4 times faster than the SWIG interface.

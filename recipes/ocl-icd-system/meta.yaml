  summary: 'Symlink an system-wide OpenCL ICD to current environment'

  description: |
    Conda-forge's ocl-icd will warn users about existing OpenCL installations
    system-wide, suggesting to symlink it to CONDA_PREFIX if no other OpenCL
    ICDs have been installed yet. This metapackage will symlink the system
    OpenCL installation to CONDA_PREFIX by default.

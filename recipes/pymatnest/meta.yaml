  summary: 'Nested Sampling code'

  description: |
    The pymatnest package is a software library for carrying out 
    nested sampling calculations. It can be used to explore the 
    energy landscape of different materials (both clusters and 
    bulk materials), calculate thermodynamic variables at arbitrary 
    temperatures, locate phase transitions and calculate the phase 
    diagram. It can be used with LAMMPS, QUIP, and the supplied 
    fortran models, and both with MC and MD.

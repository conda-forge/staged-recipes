  summary: 'The best way to have DRY Django forms. The app provides a tag and filter 
  that lets you quickly render forms in a div format while providing an enormous 
  amount of capability to configure and control the rendered HTML.'
  description: |
    Build programmatic reusable layouts out of components, having full control of the rendered 
    HTML without writing HTML in templates. All this without breaking the standard way of doing 
    things in Django, so it plays nice with any other form application.
    django-crispy-forms supports Python 2.7/Python 3.2+ and Django 1.8+
    The application mainly provides:
      - A filter named |crispy that will render elegant div based forms. Think of it as the 
        built-in methods: as_table, as_ul and as_p. You cannot tune up the output, but it is easy to start using it.
      - A tag named {% crispy %} that will render a form based on your configuration and 
        specific layout setup. This gives you amazing power without much hassle, helping you save tons of time.
    Django-crispy-forms supports several frontend frameworks, such as Twitter Bootstrap (versions 2 and 3), 
    Uni-form and Foundation. You can also easily adapt your custom company's one, creating your own, see 
    the docs for more information. You can easily switch among them using CRISPY_TEMPLATE_PACK setting variable.

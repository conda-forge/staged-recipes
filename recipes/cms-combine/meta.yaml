  summary: 'A software tool used for statistical analysis within the CMS experiment'
  description: |
    Combine is a RooStats / RooFit - based software tool used for statistical analysis within the
    CMS experiment. Note that while this tool was originally developed in the Higgs PAG, its usage
    is now widespread within CMS. Combine provides a command-line interface to many different statistical
    techniques, available inside RooFit/RooStats, that are used widely inside CMS.

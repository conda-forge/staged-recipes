  summary: 'Magnon bandstructures in Python'
  description: |
    Magnon is a Python library integrated with ASE for fast and accurate simulations of linear spin-wave theory band structures. 
    The code is versatile and applicable to a broad range of magnetic systems, including: collinear and non-collinear materials, 
    systems with Q-commensurate magnetic ordering, and cases where the exchange coupling includes off-diagonal Cartesian components 
    such as the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and Kitaev interactions. The library includes a set of propedeutically 
    structured tutorials, and a self-explanatory API that can be straightforwardly integrated into computational workflows to 
    simulate magnon properties with quantitative accuracy.

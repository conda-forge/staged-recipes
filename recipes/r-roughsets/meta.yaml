  summary: "Implementations of algorithms for data analysis based on the rough set theory (RST)
    and the fuzzy rough set theory (FRST). We not only provide implementations for the
    basic concepts of RST and FRST but also popular algorithms that derive from those
    theories. The methods included in the package can be divided into several categories
    based on their functionality: discretization, feature selection, instance selection,
    rule induction and classification based on nearest neighbors. RST was introduced
    by Zdzis\u0142aw Pawlak in 1982 as a sophisticated mathematical tool to model and
    process imprecise or incomplete information. By using the indiscernibility relation
    for objects/instances, RST does not require additional parameters to analyze the
    data. FRST is an extension of RST. The FRST combines concepts of vagueness and indiscernibility
    that are expressed with fuzzy sets (as proposed by Zadeh, in 1965) and RST."

  summary: QEMU is a generic and open source machine & userspace emulator and virtualizer.
  description: |
    QEMU is capable of emulating a complete machine in software without any
    need for hardware virtualization support. By using dynamic translation,
    it achieves very good performance. QEMU can also integrate with the Xen
    and KVM hypervisors to provide emulated hardware while allowing the
    hypervisor to manage the CPU. With hypervisor support, QEMU can achieve
    near native performance for CPUs. When QEMU emulates CPUs directly it is
    capable of running operating systems made for one machine (e.g. an ARMv7
    board) on a different machine (e.g. an x86_64 PC board).

    QEMU is also capable of providing userspace API virtualization for Linux
    and BSD kernel interfaces. This allows binaries compiled against one
    architecture ABI (e.g. the Linux PPC64 ABI) to be run on a host using a
    different architecture ABI (e.g. the Linux x86_64 ABI). This does not
    involve any hardware emulation, simply CPU and syscall emulation.

    QEMU aims to fit into a variety of use cases. It can be invoked directly
    by users wishing to have full control over its behaviour and settings.
    It also aims to facilitate integration into higher level management
    layers, by providing a stable command line interface and monitor API.
    It is commonly invoked indirectly via the libvirt library when using
    open source applications such as oVirt, OpenStack and virt-manager.

  description: |
    Hangar is based off the belief that too much time is spent collecting, managing,
    and creating home-brewed version control systems for data. At it's core Hangar
    is designed to solve many of the same problems faced by traditional code version
    control system (ie. ``Git``), just adapted for numerical data.

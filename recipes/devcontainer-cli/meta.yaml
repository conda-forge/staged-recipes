  summary: 'A reference implementation for the specification that can create and configure a dev container from a devcontainer.json. '
  description: |
    A development container allows you to use a container as a full-featured development environment. It can be used to run an application, to separate tools, libraries, or runtimes needed for working with a codebase, and to aid in continuous integration and testing. Dev containers can be run locally or remotely, in a private or public cloud.

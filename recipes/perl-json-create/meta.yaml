  summary: 'Fast, minimal, UTF-8-only serialization of data to JSON.'

  description: |
    JSON::Create encodes Perl variables into the JSON format. It offers "create_json", which uses common defaults, "create_json_strict", which accepts
    only unambiguous inputs, and a customizable object created with "new" and run with "run" where the user can specify a variety of behaviours.

    JSON::Create aims to provide fast and minimal serialization of data types. It handles no string encoding except UTF-8. The module supports
    serialization of objects and other non-data types via user-defined callbacks.

    Errors in processing result in a warning and an undefined return value. This behaviour can be altered with the method "fatal_errors".

    This module documentation is generated from machine readable code. All of the example programs in this documentation may be found in the directory
    examples/ in the distribution. All of the example outputs displayed were generated by running the example programs.

    This module is a companion to JSON::Parse for parsing JSON into Perl.

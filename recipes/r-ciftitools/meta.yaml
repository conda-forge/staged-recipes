  summary: CIFTI files contain brain imaging data in "grayordinates," which represent the gray
    matter as cortical surface vertices (left and right) and subcortical voxels (cerebellum,
    basal ganglia, and other deep gray matter). 'ciftiTools' provides a unified environment
    for reading, writing, visualizing and manipulating CIFTI-format data. It supports
    the "dscalar," "dlabel," and "dtseries" intents. Grayordinate data is read in as
    a "xifti" object, which is structured for convenient access to the data and metadata,
    and includes support for surface geometry files to enable spatially-dependent functionality
    such as static or interactive visualizations and smoothing.

  summary: 'A small replacement for GNU readline() for UNIX'
  description: |
    This is a line editing library for UNIX. It can be linked into
    almost any program to provide command line editing and history.
    It is call compatible with the FSF readline library, but is a
    fraction of the size (and offers fewer features).

  summary: 'LFPy is a Python-module for calculation of extracellular potentials from multicompartment neuron models'

  description: |
    LFPy provides a set of easy-to-use Python classes for setting up your
    model, running your simulations and calculating the extracellular
    potentials arising from activity in your model neuron. If you have a model
    working in NEURON or NeuroML2 already, it is likely that it can be adapted
    to work with LFPy.

  description: |
    Fasd (pronounced similar to "fast") is a command-line productivity booster. 
    Fasd offers quick access to files and directories for POSIX shells. 
    It is inspired by tools like autojump, z and v. 
    Fasd keeps track of files and directories you have accessed, so that you can quickly reference them in the command line.

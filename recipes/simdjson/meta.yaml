  summary: 'The fastest feature-rich C++11/14/17/20 single-header testing framework for unit tests and TDD'

  description: |
    doctest is a new C++ testing framework but is by far
    the fastest both in compile times (by orders of magnitude) and
    runtime compared to other feature-rich alternatives.
    It brings the ability of compiled languages such as D / Rust / Nim to
    have tests written directly in the production code thanks to a fast,
    transparent and flexible test runner with a clean interface.

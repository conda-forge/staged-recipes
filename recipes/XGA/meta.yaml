  summary: Python package to easily generate and analyse X-ray astronomy data products, ideal for investigating large samples of X-ray emitting objects, with many complex measurements supported.
  description: |
    XGA is designed to provide interactive and automated analyses of X-ray emitting sources observed by the X-ray telescopes, only 
    requiring a set of cleaned, processed, event lists has been created, and (optionally) that a source detector has 
    generated region lists for the observations. XGA is centered around the concept of making all available data easily accessible and 
    analysable. The user provides information (e.g. RA, Dec, redshift) on the source they wish to investigate, and XGA will locate 
    all relevant observations and generate all required data products. This approach means that the user can quickly and easily 
    complete common analyses without manually searching through large amounts of archival data for relevant observations, thus being 
    left free to focus on extracting the maximum scientific gain.

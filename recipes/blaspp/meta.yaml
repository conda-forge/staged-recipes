  summary: C++ API for the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines

  description: |
    The Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) have been around for many
    decades and serve as the de facto standard for performance-portable and
    numerically robust implementation of essential linear algebra
    functionality. Originally, they were written in Fortran, and later
    furnished with a C API (CBLAS).
    The objective of BLAS++ is to provide a convenient, performance oriented
    API for development in the C++ language, that, for the most part, preserves
    established conventions, while, at the same time, takes advantages of
    modern C++ features, such as: namespaces, templates, exceptions, etc.
    BLAS++ is part of the SLATE project (Software for Linear Algebra Targeting
    Exascale), which is funded by the Department of Energy as part of its
    Exascale Computing Initiative (ECP). Closely related to BLAS++ is the
    LAPACK++ project, which provides a C++ API for LAPACK.

  summary: A highly optimized library of floating-point neural network inference operators.
  description: |
    XNNPACK is not intended for direct use by deep learning practitioners and
    researchers; instead it provides low-level performance primitives for
    accelerating high-level machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow
    Lite, TensorFlow.js, PyTorch, and MediaPipe.

  summary: Package designed to be used with Rscript to write ``#!'' shebang scripts that accept
    short and long flags/options. Many users will prefer using instead the packages
    optparse or argparse which add extra features like automatically generated help
    option and usage, support for default values, positional argument support, etc.

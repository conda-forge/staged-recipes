  summary: A general framework for finite mixtures of regression models using the EM algorithm
    is implemented. The package provides the E-step and all data handling, while the
    M-step can be supplied by the user to easily define new models. Existing drivers
    implement mixtures of standard linear models, generalized linear models and model-based
    clustering.

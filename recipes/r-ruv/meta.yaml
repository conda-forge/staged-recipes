  summary: 'Implements the ''RUV'' (Remove Unwanted Variation) algorithms.  These algorithms
    attempt to adjust for systematic errors of unknown origin in high-dimensional data.  The
    algorithms were originally developed for use with genomic data, especially microarray
    data, but may be useful with other types of high-dimensional data as well.  These
    algorithms were proposed by Gagnon-Bartsch and Speed (2012), and by Gagnon-Bartsch,
    Jacob and Speed (2013).  The algorithms require the user to specify a set of negative
    control variables, as described in the references.  The algorithms included in this
    package are ''RUV-2'', ''RUV-4'', ''RUV-inv'', and ''RUV-rinv'', along with various
    supporting algorithms.  '

  summary: 'An extended version of portalocker to lock files in Python using the with statement'
  description: |
    Portalocker is a library to provide an easy API to file locking.

    An important detail to note is that on Linux and Unix systems the locks are
    advisory by default. By specifying the -o mand option to the mount command
    it is possible to enable mandatory file locking on Linux. This is generally
    not recommended however. See documentation for more detail.

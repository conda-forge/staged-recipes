  summary: 'flux shell plugin to bootstrap openmpi v5+'
  description: |
    This repo adds basic pmix support to Flux. It contains two main 
    components (1) a Flux shell plugin that adds pmix service to the 
    flux shell for launching some versions of openmpi (2) a Flux PMI 
    client plugin that enables Flux to be launched by a foreign launcher 
    that only supports pmix

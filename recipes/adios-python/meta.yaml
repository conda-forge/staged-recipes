  summary: 'Python bindings for the Adaptable IO System (ADIOS) for flexible and fast scientific data processing.'

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended
  description: |
    These are the python bindings for Adaptable IO System (ADIOS).
    ADIOS provides a simple, flexible way
    for scientists to describe the data in their code that may need
    to be written, read, or processed outside of the running
    simulation. By providing an external to the code XML file
    describing the various elements, their types, and how you wish
    to process them this run, the routines in the host code (either
    Fortran or C) can transparently change how they process the
    data.

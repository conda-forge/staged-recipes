  summary: "MUNGE (MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium) is an authentication service for creating and validating credentials"
  description: |
    MUNGE (MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium) is an authentication service for
    creating and validating credentials.  It is designed to be highly
    scalable for use in an HPC cluster environment.  It allows a process
    to authenticate the UID and GID of another local or remote process
    within a group of hosts having common users and groups. These hosts
    form a security realm that is defined by a shared cryptographic key.
    Clients within this security realm can create and validate credentials
    without the use of root privileges, reserved ports, or platform-specific
    methods.

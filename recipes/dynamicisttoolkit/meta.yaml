  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.

    - python
    # When setuptools is available add the `--single-version-externally-managed --record record.txt` above.
    - setuptools
    # if your project compiles code (such as a C extension) then add `toolchain` as a build requirement.

  summary: Fourier-Bessel Particle-In-Cell code (FBPIC)

  description: |
    FBPIC is a Particle-In-Cell (PIC) code for relativistic plasma physics.
    It is especially well-suited for physical simulations of laser-wakefield
    acceleration and plasma-wakefield acceleration, with close-to-cylindrical
    symmetry.

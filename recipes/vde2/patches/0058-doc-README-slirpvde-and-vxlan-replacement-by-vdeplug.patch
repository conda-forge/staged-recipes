-Slirp is free software; "free" as in you don't have to pay for it, and you
-are free to do whatever you want with it.  I do not accept any donations,
-monetary or otherwise, for Slirp.  Instead, I would ask you to pass this
-potential donation to your favorite charity.  In fact, I encourage
-*everyone* who finds Slirp useful to make a small donation to their
-favorite charity (for example, GreenPeace).  This is not a requirement, but
-a suggestion from someone who highly values the service they provide.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, each copyright

this license a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except for failure to satisfy the
conditions of this license) patent license to make, have made, use,
offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer this software,
where such license applies only to those patent claims, already
acquired or hereafter acquired, licensable by such copyright holder or
contributor that are necessarily infringed by:

(a) their Contribution(s) (the licensed copyrights of copyright
holders and non-copyrightable additions of contributors, in source or
binary form) alone; or

(b) combination of their Contribution(s) with the work of authorship
to which such Contribution(s) was added by such copyright holder or
contributor, if, at the time the Contribution is added, such addition
causes such combination to be necessarily infringed. The patent
license shall not apply to any other combinations which include the
Contribution.

  description: |
    Graph4NLP is an easy-to-use library for R&D at the intersection of Deep
     Learning on Graphs and Natural Language Processing (i.e., DLG4NLP). It
     provides both full implementations of state-of-the-art models for data
     scientists and also flexible interfaces to build customized models for
     researchers and developers with whole-pipeline support. Built upon
     highly-optimized runtime libraries including DGL , Graph4NLP has both high
     running efficiency and great extensibility.

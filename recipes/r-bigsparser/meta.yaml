  summary: Provide a sparse matrix format with data stored on disk, to be used in both R and
    C++. This is intended for more efficient use of sparse data in C++ and also when
    parallelizing, since data on disk does not need copying. Only a limited number of
    features will be implemented. For now, conversion can be performed from a 'dgCMatrix'
    or a 'dsCMatrix' from R package 'Matrix'. A new compact format is also now available.

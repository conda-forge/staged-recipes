  summary: 'Strict, simple, lightweight RFC3339 functions'
  description: |
    strict-rfc3339 is a simple & light python module to validate, parse and
    generate RFC3339 time strings. It was initially created as a part of
    habitat in response to difficulty using other libraries.

    It can convert UNIX timestamps to and from RFC3339, either producing
    strings with a UTC offset (Z) or with the offset that the C time module
    reports is the local timezone offset. It has minimal dependencies (none
    beyond those that come with Python) and avoids the error-prone act of
    dealing with timezones as much as possible. Besides that, it's designed to
    be strict and stick closely to RFC3339, with a couple of very small
    caveats. It's also fully unit tested.

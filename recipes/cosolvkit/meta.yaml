  summary: 'CosolvKit is a tool for cosolvent MD preparation and analysis'
  description: |
    CosolvKit is a tool for cosolvent MD preparation and analysis.
    It allows the user to parametrize any kind of cosolvent required
    defined by SMILES string at any concentration (M) or number of copies.
    It is built on top of OpenMM, hence it accepts all the forcefields
    available in OpenMM and it generates topology and coordinate files of the
    compatible with the required MD engine (OpenMM, Amber, GROMACS, CHARMM).
    MD simulations can be run either within cosolvkit or externally and CosolvKit
    provides a minimal analysis pipeline to analyse cosolvent densities from the trajectories.

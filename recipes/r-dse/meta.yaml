  summary: Tools for multivariate, linear, time-invariant, time series models. This includes
    ARMA and state-space representations, and methods for converting between them. It
    also includes simulation methods and several estimation functions. The package has
    functions for looking at model roots, stability, and forecasts at different horizons.
    The ARMA model representation is general, so that VAR, VARX, ARIMA, ARMAX, ARIMAX
    can all be considered to be special cases. Kalman filter and smoother estimates
    can be obtained from the state space model, and state-space model reduction techniques
    are implemented. An introduction and User's Guide is available in a vignette.

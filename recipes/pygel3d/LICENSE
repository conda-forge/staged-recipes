You are allowed to use GEL for academic or commercial purposes. In particular, you are welcome to give GEL to students as a basis for academic work or to use it in your own applications.

Regarding the use of GEL in other libraries. GEL does exist in slightly different versions, since we have created pared down packages for various courses. We would like to retain the prerogative of repackaging. If you would like to use GEL in its entirety in another library  that is fine, but we do not allow you not to take bits and pieces and put them into a different library.

If you use GEL, we would be grateful for due credit.

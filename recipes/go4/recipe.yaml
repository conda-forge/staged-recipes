  summary: |
    The object-oriented system Go4 (GSI Object Oriented On-line Off-line system)
    is based on ROOT (R. Brun et al.) with the specific requirements of the low
    and medium energy nuclear and atomic physics experiments implemented as extensions.
  description: |
    Go4 separates analysis and GUI in two tasks which could run on different nodes.
    Communication is done through threads and sockets. The GUI is built with the
    Qt widget library using the Qt designer. Qt and ROOT are interfaced by QtROOT.
    Full ROOT functionality including menus and graphics is available without modifications.
    The Go4 analysis framework provides the syntax to organize the analysis in steps
    which can be controlled from the GUI. Each step has its own IO and processing classes. 
    The Go4 event classes can be used to construct at runtime complex (composite) events which
    are stored by Go4 in trees and branches without explicit programming. The Go4 GUI includes
    a browser and tree viewer which can be used without analysis to process standard ROOT files.
    The tree viewer resolves arbitrary hierarchy levels of composite event trees.

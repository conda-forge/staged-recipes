  summary: pyo is a Python module containing classes for a wide variety of audio signal processing types

  description: |
    Pyo is a Python module written in C to help DSP script creation. Pyo
    contains classes for a wide variety of audio signal processing. With pyo,
    the user will be able to include signal processing chains directly in
    Python scripts or projects, and to manipulate them in real time through the
    interpreter. Tools in the pyo module offer primitives, like mathematical
    operations on audio signals, basic signal processing (filters, delays,
    synthesis generators, etc.), but also complex algorithms to create sound
    granulation and other creative audio manipulations. pyo supports the OSC
    protocol (Open Sound Control) to ease communications between softwares, and
    the MIDI protocol for generating sound events and controlling process
    parameters. pyo allows the creation of sophisticated signal processing
    chains with all the benefits of a mature and widely used general
    programming language.

# Jinja variables help maintain the recipe as you'll update the version only here.
# Using the name variable with the URL in line 14 is convenient
# when copying and pasting from another recipe, but not really needed.

build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python for more details.
  # noarch: python
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  # More info about selectors can be found in the conda-build docs: 
  # https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda-build/en/latest/resources/define-metadata.html#preprocessing-selectors

  build:
    # If your project compiles code (such as a C extension) then add the required compilers as separate entries here.
    # Compilers are named 'c', 'cxx' and 'fortran'.
    - {{ compiler('cxx') }}

  host:
    # All Platforms
    - python>3
    - pip
    - ruby>2
    - Qt>=5
    - make
    - zlib

test:
  # For python packages, it is useful to run pip check. However, sometimes the
  # metadata used by pip is out of date. Thus this section is optional if it is
  # failing.

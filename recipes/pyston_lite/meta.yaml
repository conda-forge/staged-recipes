  # pyston-lite uses a preprocessing script from inside the LuaJIT repository (that is not
  # packaged as part of the luajit package), but only as a build tool (ie is not included
  # in the built artifacts).

# In theory the requirements can/should be specified per-output, but in practice
# conda-build will produce a corrupt package if the compiler dependency is not
# additionally specified at this top scope. It is required to declare the
# compiler dependency both here and in the outputs: section as well; removing
# either will cause the c compiler to not be installed.
#
# It's also required to specify a "python" dependency in this section so that
# conda-build knows that this package is sensitive to the python version.
# (It does not infer this from the py!=38 jinja selector)

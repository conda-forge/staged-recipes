  description: |
    kustomize lets you customize raw, template-free YAML files for multiple purposes, leaving the original YAML untouched and usable as is.
    kustomize targets kubernetes; it understands and can patch kubernetes style API objects. It's like make, in that what it does is declared in a file, and it's like sed, in that it emits edited text.

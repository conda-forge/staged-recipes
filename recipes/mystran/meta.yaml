  description: |
    MYSTRAN is a general purpose finite element analysis computer program 
    for structures that can be modeled as linear (i.e. displacements, forces 
    and stresses proportional to applied load). MYSTRAN is an acronym for 
    "My Structural Analysis", to indicate it's usefulness in solving a wide 
    variety of finite element analysis problems. For anyone familiar with the 
    popular NASTRAN computer program developed by NASA (National Aeronautics 
    and Space Administration) in the 1970's and popularized in several 
    commercial versions since, the input to MYSTRAN will look quite familiar. 
    Indeed, many structural analyses modeled for execution in NASTRAN will 
    execute in MYSTRAN with little, or no, modification. MYSTRAN, however, 
    is not NASTRAN. All of the finite element processing to obtain the global 
    stiffness matrix (including the finite element matrix generation routines 
    themselves), the reduction of the stiffness matrix to the solution set, as 
    well as all of the input/output routines are written in independent, modern, 
    Fortran 90/95 code.

  summary: 'Cardoso''s JADE algorithm as well as his functions for joint diagonalization are
    ported to R. Also several other blind source separation (BSS) methods, like AMUSE
    and SOBI, and some criteria for performance evaluation of BSS algorithms, are given.
    The package is described in Miettinen, Nordhausen and Taskinen (2017) <doi:10.18637/jss.v076.i02>. '

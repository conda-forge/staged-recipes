  description: |
    Binder is a tool for automatic generation of Python bindings for C++11 
    projects using Pybind11 and Clang LibTooling libraries. That is, Binder,
    takes a C++ project and compiles it into objects and functions that are 
    all usable within Python. Binder is different from prior tools in that 
    it handles special features new in C++11.

  description: |
    The main goal is to create a collaborative and open tool where every user can
    characterize or analyze an astronomical photometric database while also
    contributing to the library by adding new features. Features are numerical
    descriptors that aim to characterize and distinguish the different
    variability classes.
    Our vision is to be capable of analyzing and comparing light-curves from all
    the available astronomical catalogs in a standard and universal way. This
    would facilitate and make more efficient tasks as modelling, classification,
    data cleaning, outlier detection and data analysis in general.

  summary: 'Succinct Data Structure Library for C++11'
  description: |
    The Succinct Data Structure Library (SDSL) is a powerful and flexible
    C++11 library implementing succinct data structures. In total, the
    library contains the highlights of 40 research publications. Succinct
    data structures can represent an object (such as a bitvector or a tree)
    in space close to the information-theoretic lower bound of the object
    while supporting operations of the original object efficiently. The
    theoretical time complexity of an operation performed on the classical
    data structure and the equivalent succinct data structure are (most of
    the time) identical.

  summary: Extensions to the mock library
  description: |
    The mockextras library is designed to be used with the
    unittest.mock library in python 3 or the mock backport of this
    (http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/mock/) in python 2. The mockextras
    library adds a number of features that are found in other mocking
    libraries namely: 
       * a fluent API for the configuration of stubs
       * stubs
       * matchers

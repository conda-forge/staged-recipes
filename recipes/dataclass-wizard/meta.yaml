  description: |
    The dataclass-wizard library provides a set of simple, yet
    elegant *wizarding* tools for interacting with the Python
    `dataclasses` module in Python 3.6+.

    The primary use is as a fast serialization framework that enables
    dataclass instances to be converted to/from JSON; this works well
    in particular with a *nested dataclass* model.

    The dataclass-wizard is pure Python code that relies entirely on
    stdlib, with the only added dependency being
    `typing-extensions` <https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/>
    for Python 3.9 and below.

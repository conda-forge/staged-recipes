  summary: 'Scalable asynchronous neural architecture and hyperparameter search for deep neural networks.'
  description: |
    DeepHyper is a powerful Python package for automating machine learning tasks, particularly focused on optimizing hyperparameters, searching for optimal neural architectures, and quantifying uncertainty through the use of deep ensembles. With DeepHyper, users can easily perform these tasks on a single machine or distributed across multiple machines, making it ideal for use in a variety of environments.

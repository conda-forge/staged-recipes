  summary: Implements Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots, a tool for visualizing
    the model estimated by any supervised learning algorithm. ICE plots refine Friedman's
    partial dependence plot by graphing the functional relationship between the predicted
    response and a covariate of interest for individual observations. Specifically,
    ICE plots highlight the variation in the fitted values across the range of a covariate
    of interest, suggesting where and to what extent they may exist.

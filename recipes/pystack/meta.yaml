  summary: 'Pystack is a program that can print the current stack trace for an arbitrary running Python process'

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended
  description: |
    Pystack is a program that can print the current stack trace for an arbitrary
    running Python process. It is a little like Python's traceback.print_tb(),
    but rather than being a Python function it is a CLI tool that you can run
    against arbitrary processes that weren't already instrumented to dump their
    stack.

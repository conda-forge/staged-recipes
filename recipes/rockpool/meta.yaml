  summary: 'Python package for developing, simulating and training spiking neural networks, and deploying on Neuromorphic hardware'

  description: |
    Rockpool is a Python package for working with dynamical neural network architectures, particularly for designing event-driven networks for Neuromorphic computing hardware. Rockpool provides a convenient interface for designing, training and evaluating recurrent networks, which can operate both with continuous-time dynamics and event-driven dynamics.
    Rockpool is an open-source project managed by aiCTX AG

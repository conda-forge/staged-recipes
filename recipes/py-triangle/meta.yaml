# Note: there are many handy hints in comments in this example -- remove them when you've finalized your recipe
# If your package is python based, we recommend using Grayskull to generate it instead:
# https://github.com/conda-incubator/grayskull

# Jinja variables help maintain the recipe as you'll update the version only here.
# Using the name variable with the URL in line 14 is convenient
# when copying and pasting from another recipe, but not really needed.

  summary: 'Python bindings to the triangle library'
  description: |
    Triangle generates exact Delaunay triangulations,
    constrained Delaunay triangulations, conforming Delaunay triangulations,
    Voronoi diagrams, and high-quality triangular meshes.
    The latter can be generated with no small or large angles, 
    and are thus suitable for finite element analysis.

  summary: 'A lightweight XML parser and generator in Fortran'
  description: |
        xmlf90 is a suite of libraries to handle XML in Fortran. A
	first component is a XML parsing library, designed to be a
	useful tool in the extraction and analysis of data in the
	context of scientific computing. The priorities were
	efficiency and the ability to deal with very large XML files
	while maintaining a small memory footprint. The most complete
	programming interface is based on the very successful SAX
	(Simple API for XML) model, although a partial DOM interface
	and a very experimental XPATH interface are also present. Also
	included is a library (xmlf90-wxml) that facilitates the
	writing of well-formed XML, including such features as
	automatic start-tag completion, attribute pretty-printing, and
	element indentation. There are also helper routines to handle
	the output of numerical arrays.

  summary: We solve non linear least squares problems with optional equality and/or inequality
    constraints. Non linear iterations are globalized with back-tracking method. Linear
    problems are solved by dense QR decomposition from 'LAPACK' which can limit the
    size of treated problems. On the other side, we avoid condition number degradation
    which happens in classical quadratic programming approach. Inequality constraints
    treatment on each non linear iteration is based on 'NNLS' method (by Lawson and
    Hanson). We provide an original function 'lsi_ln' for solving linear least squares
    problem with inequality constraints in least norm sens. Thus if Jacobian of the
    problem is rank deficient a solution still can be provided. However, truncation
    errors are probable in this case. Equality constraints are treated by using a basis
    of Null-space. User defined function calculating residuals must return a list having
    residual vector (not their squared sum) and Jacobian. If Jacobian is not in the
    returned list, package 'numDeriv' is used to calculated finite difference version
    of Jacobian. The 'NLSIC' method was fist published in Sokol et al. (2012) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btr716>.

# pyvips supports cffi ABI and API mode
#
# During setup.py, it will attempt to compile a generated wrapper against the
# libvips headers -- this is why it needs pkgconfig and libvips in host.
#
# At runtime, it will first try to load the compiled wrapper, and if that
# fails, will fall back to ABI mode, ie. directly opening the libvips shared
# library and calling into it with cffi.

# Skip win since libvips is not packaged for conda there. It is blocked on 
# at least gdk-pixbuf.

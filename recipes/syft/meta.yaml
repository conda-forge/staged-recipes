build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python for more details.
  noarch: python
  number: 0
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  script: "{{ PYTHON }} -m pip install . -vv"

requirements:
  build:
    # If your project compiles code (such as a C extension) then add the required compilers as separate entries here.
    # Compilers are named 'c', 'cxx' and 'fortran'.
    - {{ compiler('cxx') }} #assuming pytorch c++ code will be compiled
  host:
    - python
    - pip
  run:
    - python

test:
  # Some packages might need a `test/commands` key to check CLI.
  # List all the packages/modules that `run_test.py` imports.
  imports:
  # work on later
    - simplejson
    - simplejson.tests

  summary: 'A Library for Private, Secure Deep Learning'

  description: |
    PySyft is a Python library for secure and private Deep Learning.
    PySyft decouples private data from model training, using Federated Learning, Differential Privacy,
    and Multi-Party Computation (MPC) within the main Deep Learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

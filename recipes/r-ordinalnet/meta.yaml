  summary: Fits ordinal regression models with elastic net penalty. Supported model families
    include cumulative probability, stopping ratio, continuation ratio, and adjacent
    category. These families are a subset of vector glm's which belong to a model class
    we call the elementwise link multinomial-ordinal (ELMO) class. Each family in this
    class links a vector of covariates to a vector of class probabilities. Each of these
    families has a parallel form, which is appropriate for ordinal response data, as
    well as a nonparallel form that is appropriate for an unordered categorical response,
    or as a more flexible model for ordinal data. The parallel model has a single set
    of coefficients, whereas the nonparallel model has a set of coefficients for each
    response category except the baseline category. It is also possible to fit a model
    with both parallel and nonparallel terms, which we call the semi-parallel model.
    The semi-parallel model has the flexibility of the nonparallel model, but the elastic
    net penalty shrinks it toward the parallel model. For details, refer to Wurm, Hanlon,
    and Rathouz (2021) <doi:10.18637/jss.v099.i06>.

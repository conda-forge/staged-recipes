  summary: 'A program for maximum likelihood superpositioning and analysis of macromolecular structures'
  description: |
    Theseus is a program that simultaneously superimposes multiple macromolecular structures.
    Instead of using the conventional least-squares criteria, Theseus finds the optimal solution
    to the superposition problem using the method of maximum likelihood (ML).
    The ML method downweights variable regions of the superposition and corrects for correlations
    among atoms, producing much more accurate results.

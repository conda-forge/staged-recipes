  summary: 'RooUnfold is a framework for unfolding (AKA "deconvolution" or "unsmearing").'
  description: |
    RooUnfold is a framework for unfolding (AKA "deconvolution" or
    "unsmearing").  It can be used from the ROOT prompt, or compiled and
    linked against the ROOT libraries.  It currently implements seven
    methods:
      - iterative ("Bayesian");
      - singular value decomposition (SVD, as proposed by Höcker and Kartvelishvili and implemented in TSVDUnfold);
      - bin-by-bin (simple correction factors);
      - an interface to the TUnfold method developed by Stefan Schmitt
      - simple inversion of the response matrix without regularisation
      - iterative dynamically stabilized (IDS) unfolding
      - usage of gaussian processes (GP) for regularizing a kernel, as developed by Adam Bosson
      - Poisson unfolding, a simple likelihood unfolding

  summary: Empirical Bayes methods for learning prior distributions from data. An unknown prior
    distribution (g) has yielded (unobservable) parameters, each of which produces a
    data point from a parametric exponential family (f). The goal is to estimate the
    unknown prior ("g-modeling") by deconvolution and Empirical Bayes methods. Details
    and examples are in the paper by Narasimhan and Efron (2020, <doi:10.18637/jss.v094.i11>).

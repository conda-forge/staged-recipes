        The meta-package _{{ family }}-microarch-level enforces the microarchitecture in the
        user system.
    
        Note that a user would need the archspec conda package installed
        in the base environment where conda/mamba is run from.

        See {{ family }}-microarch-level for using this in conda recipes

        Use the meta-package {{ family }}-microarch-level in requirements/build in conda
        recipes to set up the compiler flags and set up the virtual package
        requirements in the run requirements.
    
        When building packages on CI, level=4 will not be guaranteed, so
        you can only use level<=3 to build.

        The run_exports only has a lower bound and therefore a level=2
        build can be installed on a level=3 user system. A tighter bound
        is not added because we want to be able to test both level=2 and
        level=3 on a CI machine with level=3.
        Therefore in order to prioritise the highest level, use the build
        number to prioritise the level.

        Only supported on Linux and macOS.

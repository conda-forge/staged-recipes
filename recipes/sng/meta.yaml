  summary: Enable lossless editing of PNGs via a textual representation.
  description: |
    SNG (Scriptable Network Graphics) is a minilanguage designed specifically to
    represent the entire contents of a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) file in an
    editable form. Thus, SNGs representing elaborate graphics images and ancillary
    chunk data can be readily generated or modified using only text tools.

    SNG is implemented by a compiler/decompiler called sng that losslessly
    translates between SNG and PNG.

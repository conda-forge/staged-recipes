  summary: Process Compose is a simple and flexible scheduler and orchestrator to manage non-containerized applications.
  description: |
    Because sometimes you just don't want to deal with docker files, volume definitions, networks and docker registries. 
    Since it's written in Go, Process Compose is a single binary file and has no other dependencies.

    Once installed, you just need to describe your workflow using a simple YAML schema in a file called process-compose.yaml:

    ```yaml
    version: "0.5"

    processes:
      hello:
        command: echo 'Hello World from Process Compose'
    ````

    And start it by running process-compose up from your terminal.

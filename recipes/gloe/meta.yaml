  description: |
    Gloe (pronounced /ɡloʊ/, like "glow") is a general-purpose library made to help
    developers create, maintain, document, and test both operational and flow-oriented
    code. It is particularly useful in data science and machine learning pipelines, as
    well as in servers and scripts, or any area where there is a gap between the code
    and the logical business understanding. Gloe is not intended to be used across an
    entire application or to replace existing libraries. Instead, it is built to
    integrate with other tools and to address areas where the code complexity may be
    higher than expected.

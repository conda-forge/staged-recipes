  summary: 'A Python library with an implementation of k-means clustering on 1D data'
  description: |
    Based on the algorithm from Xiaolin (1991), as presented by Gronlund et al. (2017, Section 2.2).

    Globally optimal k-means clustering is NP-hard for multi-dimensional data. Lloyd's algorithm is a popular approach for finding a locally optimal solution. For 1-dimensional data, there are polynomial time algorithms. The algorithm implemented here is an O(kn + n log n) dynamic programming algorithm for finding the globally optimal k clusters for n 1D data points.

    The code is written in C++, and wrapped with Python.

  description: |
    Jacobian-Enhanced Neural Networks (JENN) are fully connected 
    multi-layer perceptrons, whose training process is modified to 
    predict partial derivatives accurately. The main benefit of 
    is better accuracy with fewer training points compared to 
    standard fully connected neural nets.

# the VS update version.  This is the middle digit in the version reported in the VS help->about UI.  It is perhaps a more readily referenceable number.
update_version:
  - 8
# this is the version number reported by cl.exe
cl_version:
  - 19.15.26726
# this version follows the version number reported for the vcruntim140.dll file.
#     This will be in a folder like C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2017\Professional\VC\Redist\MSVC\14.15.26706\x64\Microsoft.VC141.CRT
#     Note the 14.15.26706 in there - that's what we want, but in case their folder scheme changes, it's better to base it on the version of the file itself.
runtime_version:
  - 14.15.26706
# we could zip all these together, and we should do that if there's ever more than one version supported at once.  I don't think that's currently possible, though.

# VS2017 is fundamentally compatible with VS2015.  We name our package vs2015_runtime so that it can't be
#    mixed up with the runtime from VS2015 - you do actually need VS2017 runtime for things compiled with
#    VS2017, and the runtime we have here is backwards-compatible with things compiled with VS2015.

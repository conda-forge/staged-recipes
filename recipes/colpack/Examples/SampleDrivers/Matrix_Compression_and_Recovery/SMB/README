Prerequisites:
- ColPack: http://www.cscapes.org/download/ColPack/
- ADOL-C: http://www.coin-or.org/download/source/ADOL-C/

To run this example:
- Compile ColPack and ADOL-C
- Edit the Makefile, set all the variables (ADPATH, ADLIBDIR, ADCFLAGS, ADLIBS) correctly so that the compiler can find the libraries of ColPack and ADOL-C
- Run "make"

Notes: The size of the problem can be changed by modifying the variables (nel, ndis and cstr) in eval_func_chem.c approriately.

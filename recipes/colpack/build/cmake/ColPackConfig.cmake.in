# This file is configured by CMake and installed into ColPack's installation.
# It is used by downstream (client) projects when they use
# find_package(ColPack) in their CMakeLists.txt. We define variables that
# may be useful to users and include the file that defines ColPack's targets.
# CMake will replace all variables surrounded with "at" symbols by their value.
#
# For downstream users: the available targets are:
#  - ColPack_shared (for a shared library)
#  - ColPack_static (for a static library)

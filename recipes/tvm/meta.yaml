  summary: 'Open Deep Learning Compiler Stack'
  description: |
    TVM is a compiler stack for deep learning systems. It is designed 
    to close the gap between the productivity-focused deep learning 
    frameworks, and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware 
    backends. TVM works with deep learning frameworks to provide end 
    to end compilation to different backends.

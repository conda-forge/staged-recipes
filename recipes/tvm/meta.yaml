  summary: 'Open Deep Learning Compiler Stack'
  description: |
    TVM is a compiler stack for deep learning systems. 
    It is designed to close the gap between the 
    productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, 
    and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware 
    backends. TVM works with deep learning frameworks to 
    provide end to end compilation to different backends.

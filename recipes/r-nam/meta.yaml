  summary: Designed for association studies in nested association mapping (NAM) panels, experimental
    and random panels. The method is described by Xavier et al. (2015) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv448>.
    It includes tools for genome-wide associations of multiple populations, marker quality
    control, population genetics analysis, genome-wide prediction, solving mixed models
    and finding variance components through likelihood and Bayesian methods.

  description:
    CCSDS-NDM is an open source Python package to provide read and write functionality for
    CCSDS Navigation Data Message (NDM) XML files through an auto-generated object tree.
    These NDM files carry common data types such as trajectory, orbit, attitude and
    conjunction events. These data types are routinely generated and exchanged within
    and between spacecraft operators, space agencies, researchers, amateurs and
    commercial companies - which are the natural audience for this library.

  summary: Convex Least Squares Programming (CLSP) is a two-step estimator for solving underdetermined,
    ill-posed, or structurally constrained least-squares problems. It combines pseudoinverse-based
    estimation with convex-programming correction methods inspired by Lasso, Ridge,
    and Elastic Net to ensure numerical stability, constraint enforcement, and interpretability.
    The package also provides numerical stability analysis and CLSP-specific diagnostics,
    including partial R^2, normalized RMSE (NRMSE), Monte Carlo t-tests for mean NRMSE,
    and condition-number-based confidence bands.

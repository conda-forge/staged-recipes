        description: |
          Runtime dynamically-linked library only.

          SystemC(TM) addresses the need for a system design and verification language that spans hardware
          and software. It is a language built in standard C++ by extending the language with the use of
          class libraries. The language is particularly suited to model system's partitioning, to evaluate
          and verify the assignment of blocks to either hardware or software implementations, and to
          architect and measure the interactions between and among functional blocks. Leading companies in
          the intellectual property (IP), electronic design automation (EDA), semiconductor, electronic
          systems, and embedded software industries currently use SystemC for architectural exploration,
          to deliver high-performance hardware blocks at various levels of abstraction and to develop
          virtual platforms for hardware/software co-design. SystemC has been standardized by the Open
          SystemC Initiative (OSCI) and Accellera Systems Initiative and ratified as IEEE Std. 1666(TM)-2011.

  description: |
      libSBML is a free, open-source programming library to help you read,
      write, manipulate, translate, and validate SBML files and data streams.
      It's not an application itself, but rather a library you embed in your own
      applications. The library supports all Levels and Versions of SBML, up to
      Level 3 Version 1 Core.

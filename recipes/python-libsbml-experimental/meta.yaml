  description: |
      LibSBML is an application programming interface library for
      reading, writing, manipulating and validating content
      expressed in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)
      format.
      
      It is written in ISO C and C++, provides language bindings
      for Common Lisp, Java, Python, Perl, MATLAB and Octave, and
      includes many features that facilitate adoption and use of
      both SBML and the library. Developers can embed libSBML in
      their applications, saving themselves the work of
      implementing their own SBML parsing, manipulation and
      validation software.
      
      Where python-libsbml holds all officially accepted SBML
      Level 3 extensions, python-libsbml-experimental
      additionally also contains extensions that are not
      officially ratified yet. That means that changes to the
      object structure and API are possible.

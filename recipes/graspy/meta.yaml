  description: |
    A graph, or network, provides a mathematically intuitive
    representation of data with some sort of relationship between
    items. For example, a social network can be represented as a
    graph by considering all participants in the social network as
    nodes, with connections representing whether each pair of
    individuals in the network are friends with one another.
    Naively, one might apply traditional statistical techniques
    to a graph, which neglects the spatial arrangement of nodes
    within the network and is not utilizing all of the information
    present in the graph. In this package, we provide utilities and
    algorithms designed for the processing and analysis of graphs
    with specialized graph statistical algorithms.

  summary: 'Python API for EMMO'
  description: |
    The Elemental Multiperspective Material Ontology (EMMO) is an ongoing
    effort to create an ontology that takes into account fundamental
    concepts of physics, chemistry and materials science and is designed
    to pave the road for semantic interoperability. The aim of EMMO is to
    be generic and provide a common ground for describing materials,
    models and data that can be adapted by all domains.

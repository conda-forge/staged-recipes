  description: |
    SatMAD is an open source Python package, aiming at providing the base functionality to solve 
    satellite mission analysis and design as well as orbital mechanics problems with enough 
    precision and performance to be used in the design and operation of real satellites. 
    The target audience is academics and amateur satellite community, including Cubesats 
    (and anyone else who might be interested).

  summary: '''Rcpp'' integration for ''GNU GSL'' vectors and matrices The ''GNU Scientific Library''
    (or ''GSL'') is a collection of numerical routines for scientific computing. It
    is particularly useful for C and C++ programs as it provides a standard C interface
    to a wide range of mathematical routines. There are over 1000 functions in total
    with an extensive test suite. The ''RcppGSL'' package provides an easy-to-use interface
    between ''GSL'' data structures and R using concepts from ''Rcpp'' which is itself
    a package that eases the interfaces between R and C++. This package also serves
    as a prime example of how to build a package that uses ''Rcpp'' to connect to another
    third-party library. The ''autoconf'' script, ''inline'' plugin and example package
    can all be used as a stanza to  write a similar package against another library.'

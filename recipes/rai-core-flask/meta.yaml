    **Responsible AI Toolbox**: `{{ name | lower }}`

    Responsible AI is an approach to assessing, developing, and deploying AI systems in a safe,
    trustworthy, and ethical manner, and take responsible decisions and actions.

    Responsible AI Toolbox is a suite of tools providing a collection of model and data exploration
    and assessment user interfaces and libraries that enable a better understanding of AI systems.
    These interfaces and libraries empower developers and stakeholders of AI systems to develop and
    monitor AI more responsibly, and take better data-driven actions.

    - `{{ name | lower }}` is one of the tools necessary for RAI Toolbox.

    > `{{ name | lower }}` provide environment detection for enabling Flask server without configuring
    > at instantiation. Environments are implemented as classes that will either return None if the
    > environment check fails, or return an object with all the appropriate environment settings if
    > the check passes. The flask service can then use it to build out urls, attach required headers,
    > and render inline visualizations with the correct methods.

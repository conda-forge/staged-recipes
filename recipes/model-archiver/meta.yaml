  summary: 'Model Archiver is a tool used for creating archives of trained neural net models that can be consumed by Multi-Model-Server inference.'
  description: |
    Use the Model Archiver CLI to start create a .mar file.

    A key feature of MMS is the ability to package all model artifacts into 
    a single model archive file. It is a separate command line interface (CLI), 
    model-archiver, that can take model checkpoints and package them into a .mar file. 
    This file can then be redistributed and served by anyone using MMS. 
    It takes in the following model artifacts: a model composed of one or more files, 
    the description of the model's inputs in the form of a signature file, a service 
    file describing how to handle inputs and outputs, and other optional assets that 
    may be required to serve the model. The CLI creates a .mar file that MMS's server 
    CLI uses to serve the models.

  summary: 'DART: Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit'
  description: |
    DART (Dynamic Animation and Robotics Toolkit) is a collaborative,
    cross-platform, open-source library developed by the Graphics Lab and
    Humanoid Robotics Lab at the Georgia Institute of Technology, with ongoing
    contributions from the Personal Robotics Lab at the University of Washington
    and the Open Source Robotics Foundation. It provides data structures and
    algorithms for kinematic and dynamic applications in robotics and computer
    animation. DART stands out due to its accuracy and stability, which are
    achieved through the use of generalized coordinates to represent articulated
    rigid body systems and the application of Featherstone’s Articulated Body
    Algorithm to compute motion dynamics.

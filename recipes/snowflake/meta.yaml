  summary: Snowflake Connector for Python
  description: |
    This package includes the Snowflake Connector for Python, which conforms to
    the Python DB API 2.0 specification: https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/

    The Snowflake Connector for Python provides an interface for developing
    Python applications that can connect to Snowflake and perform all standard
    operations. It provides a programming alternative to developing
    applications in Java or C/C++ using the Snowflake JDBC or ODBC drivers.

    The connector is a native, pure Python package that has no dependencies on
    JDBC or ODBC. It can be installed using pip on Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows
    platforms where either Python 2.7.9 (or higher) or Python 3.4.3 (or higher)
    is installed.

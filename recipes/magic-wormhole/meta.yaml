  summary: Get things from one computer to another, safely.
  description: |
    Get things from one computer to another, safely. This package provides a
    library and a command-line tool named wormhole, which makes it possible to
    get short pieces of text (and arbitrary-sized files and directories) from
    one computer to another. The two endpoints are identified by using
    identical "wormhole codes": in general, the sending machine generates and
    displays the code, which must then be typed into the receiving machine.
    The codes are short and human-pronounceable, using a phonetically-distinct
    wordlist. The receiving side offers tab-completion on the codewords, so
    usually only a few characters must be typed. Wormhole codes are single-use
    and do not need to be memorized.

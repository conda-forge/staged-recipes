  summary: 'A C/C++ based package for advanced data transformation and statistical computing
    in R that is extremely fast, flexible and parsimonious to code with, class-agnostic
    and programmer friendly. It is well integrated with base R, ''dplyr'' / (grouped)
    ''tibble'', ''data.table'', ''plm'' (panel-series and data frames), ''sf'' data
    frames, and non-destructively handles other matrix or data frame based classes (such
    as ''ts'', ''xts'' / ''zoo'', ''timeSeries'', ''tsibble'', ''tibbletime'' etc.)
    --- Key Features: --- (1) Advanced statistical programming: A full set of fast statistical
    functions supporting grouped and weighted computations on vectors, matrices and
    data frames. Fast and programmable grouping, ordering, unique values / rows, factor
    generation and interactions. Fast and flexible functions for data manipulation,
    data object conversions, and memory efficient R programming. (2) Advanced aggregation:
    Fast and easy multi-data-type, multi-function, weighted, parallelized and fully
    custom data aggregation. (3) Advanced transformations: Fast row / column arithmetic,
    (grouped) replacing and sweeping out of statistics, (grouped, weighted) scaling
    / standardizing, between (averaging) and (quasi-)within (demeaning) transformations,
    higher-dimensional centering (i.e. multiple fixed effects or polynomials), linear
    prediction, model fitting and testing exclusion restrictions. (4) Advanced time-computations:
    Fast (sequences of) lags / leads, and (lagged / leaded, iterated, quasi-, log-)
    differences and (compounded) growth rates on (irregular) time series and panel data.
    Multivariate auto-, partial- and cross-correlation functions for panel data. Panel
    data to (ts-)array conversions. (5) List processing: (Recursive) list search, splitting,
    extraction / subsetting, data-apply, and generalized recursive row-binding / unlisting
    in 2D. (6) Advanced data exploration: Fast (grouped, weighted, panel-decomposed)
    summary statistics for complex multilevel / panel data.'

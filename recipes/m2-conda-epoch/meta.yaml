  summary: epoch for m2 (not m2w64) packages
  description: |
    m2 packages are used as build tools for building packages on windows
    systems. These packages use the msys2 runtime, a modified Cygwin
    runtime and therefore downstream conda packages should not link to
    these packages.

    Downstream packages should link to the m2w64 packages which used
    msvcrt runtime and now use ucrt runtime.

    We package m2 x86_64 packages for both win-64 and win-arm64
    platforms as win-arm64 can run x86_64 binaries and since
    there are no arm64 msys2 packages.

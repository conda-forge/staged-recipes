  summary: 'Check your R code for some of the most common layout flaws.  Many tried to teach
    us how to write code less dreadful, be it implicitly as B. W. Kernighan and D. M.
    Ritchie (1988) <ISBN:0-13-110362-8> in ''The C Programming Language'' did, be it
    explicitly as R.C. Martin (2008) <ISBN:0-13-235088-2> in ''Clean Code: A Handbook
    of Agile Software Craftsmanship'' did.  So we should check our code for files too
    long or wide, functions with too many lines, too wide lines, too many arguments
    or too many levels of nesting. Note: This is not a static code analyzer like pylint
    or the like. Checkout <https://cran.r-project.org/package=lintr> instead.'

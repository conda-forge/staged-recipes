  summary: Meta-package to install the conda-forge-pinnings pinned version of numpy
  description: |
    This is a meta-package which depends upon the minor version of numpy that
    is referenced in the
    [conda-forge-pinning](https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock)
    pinned package list.

    This is meant to make it easier to construct development environments that
    build software against the oldest conda-forge supported version of NumPy,
    maximising ABI compatibility.

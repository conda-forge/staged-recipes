  summary: This is a package that allows conversion to and from  data in Javascript object notation
    (JSON) format. This allows R objects to be inserted into Javascript/ECMAScript/ActionScript
    code and allows R programmers to read and convert JSON content to R objects. This
    is an alternative to rjson package. Originally, that was too slow for converting
    large R objects to JSON and was not extensible.  rjson's performance is now similar
    to this package, and perhaps slightly faster in some cases. This package uses methods
    and is readily extensible by defining methods for different classes,  vectorized
    operations, and C code and callbacks to R functions for deserializing JSON objects
    to R.  The two packages intentionally share the same basic interface. This package
    (RJSONIO) has many additional options to allow customizing the generation and processing
    of JSON content. This package uses libjson rather than implementing yet another
    JSON parser. The aim is to support other general projects by building on their work,
    providing feedback and benefit from their ongoing development.

  summary: A general framework for constructing variable importance plots from  various types
    of machine learning models in R. Aside from some standard model- specific variable
    importance measures, this package also provides model- agnostic approaches that
    can be applied to any supervised learning algorithm. These include an efficient
    permutation-based variable importance measure as  well as novel approaches based
    on partial dependence plots (PDPs) and  individual conditional expectation (ICE)
    curves which are described in  Greenwell et al. (2018) <arXiv:1805.04755>. An experimental
    method for  quantifying the relative strength of interaction effects is also included
    (see  the previous reference for details).

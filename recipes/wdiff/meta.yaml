  description: |
    `wdiff' is a front-end to GNU `diff'.  It compares two files, finding
    which words have been deleted or added to the first in order to create
    the second.  It has many output formats and interacts well with
    terminals and pagers (notably with `less').  `wdiff' is particularly
    useful when two texts differ only by a few words and paragraphs have
    been refilled.

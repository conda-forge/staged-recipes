  summary: |
    A low-level library to perform the matrix building step in cvxpy,
    a convex optimization modeling software.
  description: |
    Convex optimization modeling tools like CVX, CVXPY, and Convex.Jl translate
    high-level problem descriptions into low-level, canonical forms that are
    then passed to an backend solver. CVXcanon is a software package that factors
    out the common operations that all such modeling systems perform into a single
    library with a simple C++ interface. CVXcanon removes the need to reimplement
    this canonicalization process in new languages and provides significant
    performance gains over high level language implemententations.

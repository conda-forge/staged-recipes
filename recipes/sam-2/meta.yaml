  summary: 'SAM 2: Segment Anything in Images and Videos'
  description: |
    Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) is a foundation model towards solving
    promptable visual segmentation in images and videos. We extend SAM to video
    by considering images as a video with a single frame. The model design is a
    simple transformer architecture with streaming memory for real-time video
    processing. We build a model-in-the-loop data engine, which improves model
    and data via user interaction, to collect our SA-V dataset, the largest
    video segmentation dataset to date. SAM 2 trained on our data provides
    strong performance across a wide range of tasks and visual domains.

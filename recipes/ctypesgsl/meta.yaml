  summary: ctypesGsl is a Python binding for the GSL library using the ctypes package
  description: |
    It is probably somewhat slower than pygsl but has other advantages:

      1. It is very easy to install, the only dependency (except for GSL itself)
        is the ctypes package, standard since Python 2.5. No compilation or is
        required during installation. The implementation is simpler too as it
        does not require SWIG wrappers, C code or shared libraries.
      2. ctypes seems to be the preferred future way to do Python bindings,
        since it is independent from python implementation used, e.g. it should
        work with PyPy.

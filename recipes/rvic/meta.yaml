  summary: 'RVIC Streamflow Routing Model'

  description: |
    The RVIC streamflow routing model is an adapted version of the model the
    model typically used as a post-processor with the Variable Infiltration
    Capacity (VIC) hydrology model. The routing model is a source-to-sink model
    that solves a linearized version of the Saint-Venant equations. This
    model, developed by Lohmann et al. (1996, 1998a, 1998b), has been used in
    many offline studies at a variety of spatial scales. Furthermore, the
    development of the impulse response functions (IRFs) is done as a
    preprocessing step, which considerably reduces the computation time in
    subsequent routing steps.

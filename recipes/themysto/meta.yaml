  # we can't use noarch_python because it places prohibitive restrictions:
  #  - can't specify supported version
  #  - attempts to roll its own pre/post-link scripts, complaining about existing ones.
  entry_points:
    # Put any entry points (scripts to be generated automatically) here.
    # The syntax is module:function

test:

  # Python imports
  imports:
    - themysto
    - themysto.extensions
    - themysto.nbextensions_configurator
    - themysto.postprocessors
    - themysto.preprocessors

    - themysto --help
    - themysto install --help
    - themysto uninstall --help
    - themysto retire --help

  # You can also put a file called run_test.py in the recipe that will be run
  # at test time. We don't, because conda doesn't provide tox or selenium, so
  # it's pretty useless for running tests. Rely instead on CI testing.

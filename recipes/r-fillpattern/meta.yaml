  summary: Adds distinctive yet unobtrusive geometric patterns where solid color fills are normally
    used. Patterned figures look just as professional when viewed by colorblind readers
    or when printed in black and white. The dozen included patterns can be customized
    in terms of scale, rotation, color, fill, line type, and line width. Compatible
    with the 'ggplot2' package as well as 'grid' graphics.

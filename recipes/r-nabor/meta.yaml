  summary: An R wrapper for 'libnabo', an exact or approximate k nearest neighbour library which
    is optimised for low dimensional spaces (e.g. 3D). 'libnabo' has speed and space
    advantages over the 'ANN' library wrapped by package 'RANN'. 'nabor' includes a
    knn function that is designed as a drop-in replacement for 'RANN' function nn2.
    In addition, objects which include the k-d tree search structure can be returned
    to speed up repeated queries of the same set of target points.

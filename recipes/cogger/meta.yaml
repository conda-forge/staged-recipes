    summary: "cogger is a fast geotiff to COG converter"
    description: |
        Cogger is a standalone binary and a golang library that reads an
        internally tiled geotiff (optionally with overviews and masks) and
        rewrites it as a Cloud Optimized Geotiff (COG). This process being a
        reshuffling of the original geotiff's bytes, it should run as fast as
        the underlying disk or network i/o.

  summary: 'Pipe Viewer'
  description: |
    pv - Pipe Viewer - is a terminal-based tool for monitoring the progress of
    data through a pipeline. It can be inserted into any normal pipeline between
    two processes to give a visual indication of how quickly data is passing through,
    how long it has taken, how near to completion it is, and an estimate of how long
    it will be until completion.

  summary: "A C++ Module Library offering a full XML library with validating parser, DOM tree, XPaths and serialization."
  description: >
    This is a feature complete XML library containing a validating parser as well as a modern C++ API for the data structures.
    It also supports serializing custom data structures.

    The core of this library is a validating XML parser with DTD processing and all.
    On top of this are implemented an API for manipulating XML data in a DOM like fashion and a serialization API.
    As a bonus there’s also an XPath implementation, albeit this is limited to XPath 1.0.

    This XML library was extracted from [libzeep](https://github.com/mhekkel/libzeep) since having a separate and simple XML library is more convenient.
    The API is unfortunately no longer compatible since the goal was to be more standards compliant.
    E.g., mxml::element should now be a complete [Sequence Container](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/named_req/SequenceContainer).

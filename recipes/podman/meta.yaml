  description: |
    Podman (the POD MANager) is a tool for managing containers and images, volumes mounted into those containers,
    and pods made from groups of containers. Podman is based on libpod, a library for container lifecycle management
    that is also contained in this repository. The libpod library provides APIs for managing containers, pods,
    container images, and volumes.

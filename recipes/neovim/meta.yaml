  summary: 'Vim-fork focused on extensibility and agility'
  description: |
    Neovim is a refactor—and sometimes redactor—in the tradition of
    Vim, which itself derives from Stevie. It is not a rewrite but a continuation
    and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist; some are very clever,
    but none are Vim. Neovim strives to be a superset of Vim except for some
    intentionally-removed misfeatures. It is built for users who want the good
    parts of Vim, and more.

  summary: |
    Operations on triangular meshes based on 'VCGLIB'. This package integrates 
    nicely with the R-package 'rgl' to render the meshes processed by 'Rvcg'. 
    The Visualization and Computer Graphics Library (VCG for short) is an open 
    source portable C++ templated library for manipulation, processing and 
    displaying with OpenGL of triangle and tetrahedral meshes. The library, 
    composed by more than 100k lines of code, is released under the GPL 
    license, and it is the base of most of the software tools of the Visual
    Computing Lab of the Italian National Research Council Institute ISTI 
    <http://vcg.isti.cnr.it>, like 'metro' and 'MeshLab'. The 'VCGLIB' source 
    is pulled from trunk <https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/vcglib>
    and patched to work with options determined by the configure script as 
    well as to work with the header files included by 'RcppEigen'.

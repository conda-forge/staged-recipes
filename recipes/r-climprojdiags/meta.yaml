  summary: Set of tools to compute metrics and indices for climate analysis. The package provides
    functions to compute extreme indices, evaluate the agreement between models and
    combine theses models into an ensemble. Multi-model time series of climate indices
    can be computed either after averaging the 2-D fields from different models provided
    they share a common grid or by combining time series computed on the model native
    grid. Indices can be assigned weights and/or combined to construct new indices.

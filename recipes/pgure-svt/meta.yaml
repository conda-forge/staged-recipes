  summary: 'Singular value thresholding for denoising time-resolved microscopy'
  description: |
    PGURE-SVT (Poisson-Gaussian Unbiased Risk Estimator - Singular Value Thresholding) is an algorithm designed to denoise image sequences acquired in microscopy. It exploits the correlations between consecutive frames to form low-rank matrices, which are then recovered using a technique known as nuclear norm minimization. An unbiased risk estimator for mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise is used to automate the selection of the regularization parameter, while robust noise and motion estimation maintain broad applicability to many different types of microscopy.

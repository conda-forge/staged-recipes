  summary: 'Python Implementation for Spline-based Abel Transform'
  description: |
    In combustion research, optical diagnostics often necessitate Abel inversion to deconvolve the measurements of axisymmetric flames, especially to determine local soot temperature fields from integrated flame radiative emission measurements. However, traditional Abel inversion methods can considerably amplify experimental noise, especially towards the flame centerline. Although various strategies exist to mitigate this issue, they typically do not address the correction of signal trapping within the flame. In this context, pySAT is developed as an alternative without noise amplification, capable of correcting the signal trapping effect in different flame configurations.

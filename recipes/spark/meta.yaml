# Note: there are many handy hints in comments in this example -- remove them when you've finalized your recipe
# If your package is python based, we recommend using Grayskull to generate it instead:
# https://github.com/conda-incubator/grayskull

# Jinja variables help maintain the recipe as you'll update the version only here.
# Using the name variable with the URL in line 16 is convenient
# when copying and pasting from another recipe, but not really needed.

  summary: Provides functionality to perform machine-learning-based modeling in a computation
    pipeline. Its functions contain the basic steps of machine-learning-based knowledge
    discovery workflows, including model training and optimization, model evaluation,
    and model testing. To perform these tasks, the package builds heavily on existing
    machine-learning packages, such as 'caret' <https://github.com/topepo/caret/> and
    associated packages. The package can train multiple models, optimize model hyperparameters
    by performing a grid search or a random search, and evaluates model performance
    by different metrics. Models can be validated either on a test data set, or in case
    of a small sample size by k-fold cross validation or repeated bootstrapping. It
    also allows for 0-Hypotheses generation by performing permutation experiments. Additionally,
    it offers methods of model interpretation and item categorization to identify the
    most informative features from a high dimensional data space. The functions of this
    package can easily be integrated into computation pipelines (e.g. 'nextflow' <https://www.nextflow.io/>)
    and hereby improve scalability, standardization, and re-producibility in the context
    of machine-learning.

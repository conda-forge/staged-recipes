# This example shows how to define a recipe using the new YAML based recipe format introduced by 
# CEP 13.

# For more information about this format see: https://prefix-dev.github.io/rattler-build/latest/reference/recipe_file/

# The main differences with the old format is that no preprocessing is required for the file to be valid YAML.
# This means:
# - No "selectors", use YAML if-then-else expressions instead (https://prefix-dev.github.io/rattler-build/latest/selectors/)
# - Jinja expressions are formatted with a leading `$` to make them valid YAML

# Note: there are many handy hints in comments in this example -- remove them when you've finalized your recipe

# Define variables in this section that you can use in other parts.

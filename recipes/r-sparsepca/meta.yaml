  summary: Sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) attempts to find sparse weight vectors
    (loadings), i.e., a weight vector with only a few 'active' (nonzero) values. This
    approach provides better interpretability for the principal components in high-dimensional
    data settings. This is, because the principal components are formed as a linear
    combination of only a few of the original variables. This package provides efficient
    routines to compute SPCA. Specifically, a variable projection solver is used to
    compute the sparse solution. In addition, a fast randomized accelerated SPCA routine
    and a robust SPCA routine is provided. Robust SPCA allows to capture grossly corrupted
    entries in the data. The methods are discussed in detail by N. Benjamin Erichson
    et al. (2018) <arXiv:1804.00341>.

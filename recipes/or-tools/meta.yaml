        OR-Tools is an open source software suite for optimization, tuned for tackling
        the world's toughest problems in vehicle routing, flows, integer and linear
        programming, and constraint programming.

        After modeling your problem in the programming language of your choice, you
        can use any of a half dozen solvers to solve it: commercial solvers such as
        Gurobi or CPLEX, or open-source solvers such as SCIP, GLPK, or Google's GLOP
        and award-winning CP-SAT.

  summary: 'Materials graph network with 3-body interactions featuring a DFT surrogate crystal relaxer and a state-of-the-art property predictor.'
  description: |
    M3GNet is a new materials graph neural network architecture that incorporates 3-body interactions. 
    A key difference with prior materials graph implementations is the addition of the coordinates for
    atoms and the 3×3 lattice matrix in crystals, which are necessary for obtaining tensorial quantities
    such as forces and stresses via auto-differentiation.

  summary: 'Python implementations of the Inflation Technique for causal inference'
  description: |
    Inflation is a Python package that implements Inflation algorithms for causal inference. Inflation algorithms are a class of techniques designed to solve the causal compatibility problem, that is, test compatibility between some observed data and a given causal relationship. Examples of use of this package include: 1) feasibility problems and extraction of certificates, 2) optimization of Bell operators, 3) optimisation over classical distributions, 4) standard Navascués-Pironio-Acín hierarchy, ... see the documentation for more details. This package requires MOSEK for solving generated relaxations: conda install -c mosek mosek

  summary: Functions, data sets and examples for the calculation of various indices of biodiversity
    including species, functional and phylogenetic diversity. Part of the indices are
    expressed in terms of equivalent numbers of species. The package also provides ways
    to partition biodiversity across spatial or temporal scales (alpha, beta, gamma
    diversities). In addition to the quantification of biodiversity, ordination approaches
    are available which rely on diversity indices and allow the detailed identification
    of species, functional or phylogenetic differences between communities.

requirements:
  build:
    - {{ compiler('fortran') }}  # [not win]
    # Windows: complation with flang fails because the provided flang version 5 does not provide
    # a NORM2 intrinsic; wait for https://github.com/conda-forge/conda-forge-pinning-feedstock/issues/5081
    - {{ compiler('m2w64_fortran') }}  # [win]
    - {{ stdlib('c') }}
    - cmake
    - ninja
    - llvm-openmp  # [osx]
    - libgomp  # [win or linux]
    - fftw
  host:
    - fftw
    - libblas
    - liblapack

test:
  source_files:
    - examples/SimpleSystems/bccFe
  commands:
    - cd examples/SimpleSystems/bccFe && sd  # [not win and build_platform == target_platform]
    - cd examples/SimpleSystems/bccFe && sd.exe  # [win]

outputs:
  # For now only distribute the binary but not the static library. Building a shared
  # library would be preferable but seems to not be straightforward for UppASD (some
  # things are hardcoded in their CMakeLists.txt).

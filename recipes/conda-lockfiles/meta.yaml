  summary: conda-lockfiles adds support for additional lockfile formats to conda.
  description: |
    Lock files record the exact state of an environment so that it can be
    reproduced at a later date or shared with collaborators. conda-lockfiles
    brings native lockfile support to conda with the ability to create and use
    lockfiles across multiple formats and platforms. With multiplatform
    support, you can solve environments once and deploy them consistently
    across Linux, macOS, and Windows.

  summary: 'A bioinformatics workflow engine built on top of the Workflow Description Language (WDL).'
  description: |
    Sprocket is an bioinformatics workflow execution engine built on top of the Workflow Description Language.
    The project has multiple high-level goals, including to:

    - Provide a high-performance workflow execution engine capable of orchestrating massive bioinformatics workloads (the stated target is 20,000+ concurrent jobs).
    - Develop a suite of modern development tools that brings bioinformatics development on par with other modern languages (e.g., wdl-lsp).
    - Maintain an community-focused codebase that enables a diverse set of contributors from academic, non-profit, and commercial organizations.
    - Build on an open, domain-tailored standard to ensure the toolset remains singularly focused on unencumbered innovation within bioinformatics.
    - Retain a simple and accessible user experience when complexity isn't warranted.

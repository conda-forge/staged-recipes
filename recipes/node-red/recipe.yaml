  description: |
     Node-RED's goal is to enable anyone to build applications that collect,
     transform and visualize their data; 
     building flows that can automate their world. 
     Its low-code nature makes it accessible to users of any background, 
     whether for home automation,
     industrial control systems or anything in between.

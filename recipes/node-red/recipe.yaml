  summary: Low-code programming for event-driven applications
  description: |
    Node-RED's goal is to enable anyone to build applications that collect,
      transform and visualize their data;
      building flows that can automate their world.
      Its low-code nature makes it accessible to users of any background,
      whether for home automation,
      industrial control systems or anything in between.

  summary: GPU-Enabled, Zero-Copy AMReX Python Bindings including AI/ML

  description: |
    The Python binding pyAMReX bridges the worlds of block-structured codes and
    data science: it provides zero-copy application GPU data access for AI/ML,
    in situ analysis, application coupling and enables rapid, massively
    parallel prototyping. pyAMReX enhances the Block-Structured AMR Software
    Framework AMReX and its applications.
    AMReX is a software framework containing all the functionality to write
    massively parallel, block-structured adaptive mesh refinement (AMR)
    applications.

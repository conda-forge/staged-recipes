  summary: Cloth Simulation Filter (CSF) is an airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) ground  points
    filtering algorithm  which is based on cloth simulation. It tries to simulate the
    interactions between the cloth nodes and the corresponding LiDAR points, the locations
    of the cloth nodes can be determined to generate an approximation of the ground
    surface.

  description: |
    This is another C library for creating and manipulating graphs. You can look
    at it two ways: first, igraph contains the implementation of quite a lot
    graph algorithms. These include classic graph algorithms like graph
    isomorphism, graph girth and connectivity and also the new wave graph
    algorithms like transitivity, graph motifs and community structure detection.

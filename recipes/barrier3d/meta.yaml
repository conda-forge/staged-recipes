  summary: "A spatially explicit exploratory model of barrier island evolution"
  description: |
    Barrier3D resolves cross-shore and alongshore topographic variations and
    simulates the morphological evolution of a barrier segment over time scales
    of years to centuries. The model explicitly yet efficiently simulates dune
    evolution, storm overwash, and a dynamically evolving shoreface in response
    to individual storm events and sea-level rise.

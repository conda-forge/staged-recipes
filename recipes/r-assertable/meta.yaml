  summary: Simple, flexible, assertions on data.frame or data.table objects with verbose output
    for vetting. While other assertion packages apply towards more general use-cases,
    assertable is tailored towards tabular data. It includes functions to check variable
    names and values, whether the dataset contains all combinations of a given set of
    unique identifiers, and whether it is a certain length. In addition, assertable
    includes utility functions to check the existence of target files and to efficiently
    import multiple tabular data files into one data.table.

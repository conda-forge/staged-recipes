  summary: A faster version of Apple's linker
  description: |
    For large projects, the linking phase can significantly increase incremental build times. This project is a fork of the Apple linker, ld. It is a drop-in replacement that can substantially speed things up.
    Note: it is only intended for debug builds, to make debugging faster

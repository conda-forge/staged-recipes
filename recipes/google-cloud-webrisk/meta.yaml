  summary: 'Google Cloud Web Risk API client library'
  description: Web Risk API is a Google Cloud service that lets client applications 
    check URLs against Google's constantly updated lists of unsafe web resources. Unsafe 
    web resources include social engineering sites such as phishing and deceptive sites 
    and sites that host malware or unwanted software. With the Web Risk API, you can quickly 
    identify known bad sites, warn users before they click infected links, and prevent users 
    from posting links to known infected pages from your site. The Web Risk API includes data 
    on more than a million unsafe URLs and stays up to date by examining billions of URLs 
    each day.

    See the [quick start guide](https://cloud.google.com/web-risk/docs/quickstart).

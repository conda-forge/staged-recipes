  summary: A wide range of functions for phylogenetic analysis. Functionality is concentrated
    in phylogenetic comparative biology, but also includes numerous methods for visualizing,
    manipulating, reading or writing, and even inferring phylogenetic trees and data.
    Included among the functions in phylogenetic comparative biology are various for
    ancestral state reconstruction, model-fitting, simulation of phylogenies and data,
    and multivariate analysis. There are a broad range of plotting methods for phylogenies
    and comparative data which include, but are not restricted to, methods for mapping
    trait evolution on trees, for projecting trees into phenotypic space or a geographic
    map, and for visualizing correlated speciation between trees. Finally, there are
    a number of functions for reading, writing, analyzing, inferring, simulating, and
    manipulating phylogenetic trees and comparative data not covered by other packages.
    For instance, there are functions for randomly or non-randomly attaching species
    or clades to a phylogeny, for estimating supertrees or consensus phylogenies from
    a set, for simulating trees and phylogenetic data under a range of models, and for
    a wide variety of other manipulations and analyses that phylogenetic biologists
    might find useful in their research.

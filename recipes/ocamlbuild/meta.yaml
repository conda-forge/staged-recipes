  description: |
    OCaml is an implementation of the ML language, based on the Caml Light
    dialect extended with a complete class-based object system and a powerful
    module system in the style of Standard ML.

    OCamlbuild was distributed as part of the OCaml distribution for OCaml
    versions between 3.10.0 and 4.02.3. Starting from OCaml 4.03, it is now
    released separately (with its own version numbering).

    You should refer to the OCambuild manual for more informations on how to
    use ocamlbuild.

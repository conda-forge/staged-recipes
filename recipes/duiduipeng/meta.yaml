  summary: 'Analyse the DuiDuiPeng game, give an optimal strategy'
  description: |
    Find the optimal strategy for the DuiDuiPeng Game. 
    Using Monte Carlo method to simulate the game, and to approximate the expectations
    under different strategies.
    Look for how many balls to buy first and you will get the relatively more balls.
    It can also analyse the convergence of number of balls you will have if you can buy 
    infinite balls.

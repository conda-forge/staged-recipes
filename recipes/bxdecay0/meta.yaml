  summary: Library for the random generation of simulated nuclear decays
  description: |
    The BxDecay0 C++ library provides a set of classes and functions for the
    random generation of simulated nuclear decays. It consists in a C++ port of
    he original Decay0 Fortran program (also known as GENBB in some other
    context) written and maintained by Volodymyr Tretyak (KINR). Decay0 was
    created to address the Monte Carlo generation of nuclear decays in the
    context of double beta decay and dark matter experimental research.

    BxDecay0 aims to be used by any C++ simulation program that needs to
    generate the kinematics of primary particles emitted from specific nuclear
    decays (example: input for a Geant4 based Monte Carlo simulation program).
    It can be easily interfaced with the HepMC event/particle model or any
    other client application.

    BxDecay0 provides an extension library which implements an interface for
    Geant4 (through a PrimaryGeneratorAction class and its associated
    messenger).

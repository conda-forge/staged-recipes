  summary: 'Astronomical package for spatial and spectral coordinates, WCS projections and transformation, and more...'
  description: |
        The Kapteyn Package is a collection of Python modules and applications
        developed by members of the computer group (*) of the Kapteyn
        Astronomical Institute, University of Groningen, The Netherlands.  The
        purpose of the package is to provide tools for the development of
        astronomical applications with Python.

        The package is suitable for both inexperienced and experienced users and
        developers and documentation is provided for both groups.  The
        documentation also provides in-depth chapters about celestial
        transformations and spectral translations.

        Some of the package's features:

           * The handling of spatial and spectral coordinates, WCS projections
             and transformations between different sky systems.  Spectral
             translations (e.g., between frequencies and velocities) are supported
             and also mixed coordinates.  (Modules wcs and celestial. Module wcs
             uses Mark Calabretta's WCSLIB which is distributed with the package.)

           * Versatile tools for writing small and dedicated applications for
             the inspection of FITS headers, the extraction and display of (FITS)
             data, interactive inspection of this data (color editing) and for the
             creation of plots with world coordinate information.  (Module maputils)
             As one example, a gallery of all-sky plots is provided.

           * A class for the efficient reading, writing and manipulating simple
             table-like structures in text files.  (Module tabarray)

           * Utilities for use with matplotlib such as obtaining coordinate
             information from plots, interactively modifiable colormaps and timer
             events (module mplutil); tools for parsing and interpreting coordinate
             information entered by the user (module positions).

           * A function to search for gaussian components in a profile
             (module profiles) and a class for non-linear least squares fitting
             (module kmpfit).

  description: |
    diffpy.morph is a Python software package designed to increase the insight researchers can obtain from comparing 1D signals/functions in a model-independent way.
    The program finds the best 'morphs' (e.g. x/y-axis scaling, shifting, Gaussian smearing) to apply to transform one signal to another target signal.
    The program was originally designed to help researchers determine whether a phase transition has occurred across two spectral data measured at different temperatures.

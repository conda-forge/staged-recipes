# Variants configuration for mumble-voip recipe
# This file defines variant dimensions that will be combined to generate build variants
# Only non-default values from conda-forge-pinning are set here

# macOS-specific configuration - this is the main value that needs to be set
# as it's not in conda-forge-pinning defaults
MACOSX_SDK_VERSION:
  - if: osx and x86_64
    then: "11.0"
# All other values (c_compiler_version, cxx_compiler_version, c_stdlib_version,
# MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET, python, vc, etc.) are removed as they match
# conda-forge-pinning defaults or should be handled via CXXFLAGS

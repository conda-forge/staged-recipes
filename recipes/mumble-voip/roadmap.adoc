= Mumble VoIP Package Roadmap
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

== Current Status

The mumble-voip conda-forge package is under development with the following components:

* ✓ Windows build with MSVC flag fixes
* ✓ **macOS build (using conda-forge best practices)**
* !  Linux build (untested)
* ✓ Server package (`mumble-server`) - primary focus
* !  Client package (`mumble`) - commented out for now

== Recent Changes

=== macOS Build Configuration Modernization

==== Approach
- Uses conda-forge recommended `-D_LIBCPP_DISABLE_AVAILABILITY` flag
- Sets only `MACOSX_SDK_VERSION: "11.0"` in variants.yaml
- Lets conda-forge-pinning handle deployment targets and compiler selection
- Simplified to ~6 lines of clean macOS build configuration
- Follows conda-forge C++ best practices

=== Variants Configuration Cleanup

- `MACOSX_SDK_VERSION: "11.0"` for osx x86_64 (not in conda-forge-pinning)

== Technical Implementation

=== macOS C++ Compatibility Strategy

The new approach uses the standard conda-forge method for C++ programs that need newer features on older macOS:

```cmake
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS = "-D_LIBCPP_DISABLE_AVAILABILITY"
```

This flag:
- Disables C++ standard library availability checks
- Allows use of newer C++ features on older deployment targets
- Is the recommended approach per conda-forge documentation
- Works with conda's automatic SDK and compiler management

=== Build Configuration

Current `variants.yaml`:
```yaml
# Only non-default values from conda-forge-pinning are set here
MACOSX_SDK_VERSION:
  - if: osx and x86_64
    then: "11.0"
```

Current macOS build flags:
```cmake
CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS = "-Wno-deprecated-declarations -D_LIBCPP_DISABLE_AVAILABILITY"
CMAKE_C_FLAGS = "-Wno-deprecated-declarations -std=c11"
```

=== License Compliance

The recipe properly handles license compliance through conda-build's automatic license handling via the `license_file` specification in the recipe's `about` section:

* **Main License**: `src/mumble/LICENSE` (BSD-3-Clause)
* **3rdPartyLicenses Directory**: Complete `src/mumble/3rdPartyLicenses/` directory from upstream
* **Individual 3rd Party Licenses**:
  - GSL (Microsoft Guidelines Support Library)
  - Tracy profiler
  - SpeexDSP

License files are automatically included by conda-build based on the `license_file` field, eliminating the need for manual license copying in the build script.

**Dependency Strategy**: This package uses a hybrid approach combining conda-forge dependencies where available with bundled dependencies where necessary. Three key dependencies have been migrated to conda-forge packages, while others remain bundled for compatibility or availability reasons.

=== 3rd Party Library conda-forge Migration Status

**✓ Using conda-forge packages:**

* **nlohmann_json** - v3.12.0 ✓
* **spdlog** - v1.15.3 ✓
* **utfcpp** - v4.0.6 ✓

**! Available but not yet migrated:**

* **soci** - Available through conda-forge (soci-core, soci-mysql, soci-postgresql, soci-sqlite) !
* **tracy** - Available as tracy-profiler-client-python v0.11.1 (requires C++ library verification) !

**❌ Using bundled versions:**

* **speexdsp** - Only found `speex` codec and `m2w64-speexdsp` for Windows ❌
* **GSL** (Microsoft Guidelines Support Library) - No conda-forge package found ❌
* **ReNameNoise** - Mumble-specific fork ❌
* **minhook** - Mumble-specific fork, Windows-only ❌
* **SPSCQueue** - Mumble-specific fork ❌
* **mach_override** - Mumble-specific fork, macOS-only ❌
* **FindPythonInterpreter** - CMake utility, not typically packaged ❌
* **cmake-compiler-flags** - CMake utility, not typically packaged ❌

**Current Status:**
1. **✓ Active conda-forge usage**: nlohmann_json, spdlog, utfcpp
2. **📋 Migration candidates**: soci (requires configuration evaluation)
3. **🔍 Under evaluation**: tracy (requires C++ library vs Python bindings verification)

**Benefits of conda-forge integration:**
- Automatic security updates and bug fixes
- Reduced build time (no compilation of external libraries)
- Better integration with conda ecosystem
- Reduced license tracking complexity

**Implementation approach:**
- Version compatibility confirmed for migrated dependencies
- No ABI compatibility issues observed
- CMake automatically detects conda-forge packages

=== Current Migration Progress

**Phase 1: Initial conda-forge integration (✓ COMPLETED)**

*Changes made:*
- ✓ Added conda-forge dependencies to host requirements:
  - `nlohmann_json >=3.11.3` (conda-forge: v3.12.0)
  - `spdlog >=1.10.0` (conda-forge: v1.15.3)
  - `utfcpp >=3.2.0` (conda-forge: v4.0.6)
- ✓ Removed bundled source downloads for nlohmann_json, spdlog, utfcpp
- ✓ Removed license handling for migrated dependencies
- ✓ **BUILD SUCCESS** - Mumble's CMake correctly detected conda-forge packages automatically
- ✓ Fixed nushell script issues (stdlib functions, find command syntax)
- ✓ Simplified license file handling (removed manual license copying - conda-build handles this automatically)
- ✓ Extracted build script to external `build.nu` file for better maintainability

*Current Results:*
- **Build time improvement**: No compilation required for 3 external dependencies
- **Package size optimization**: Uses shared conda-forge libraries
- **Automatic dependency resolution**: CMake finds packages without manual intervention
- **Maintainability**: Reduced license tracking burden for external dependencies

**Phase 2: Additional dependencies (PLANNED)**

*Future migration candidates:*
- **tracy profiler** - Available as `tracy-profiler-client-python` (requires C++ library verification)
- **soci** - Available through conda-forge (soci-core, soci-mysql, etc.) (requires integration analysis)

*Remaining bundled dependencies:*
- **GSL** (Microsoft Guidelines Support Library) - No conda-forge package
- **speexdsp** - Only platform-specific packages available
- **Platform-specific forks** - ReNameNoise, minhook, SPSCQueue, mach_override
- **CMake utilities** - FindPythonInterpreter, cmake-compiler-flags

**Phase 3: Cross-platform testing (FUTURE WORK)**
- Build and test on macOS and Windows platforms
- Verify runtime functionality with conda-forge dependencies across platforms
- Performance comparison with previous bundled approach
- Document any platform-specific considerations

**Lessons Learned:**
- CMake's find_package() works well with conda-forge installations
- Manual CMake directory hints were unnecessary
- Nushell script syntax requires careful escaping for shell commands
- License files are automatically handled by conda-build via `license_file` specification - no manual copying needed
- External nushell build scripts (`build.nu`) provide better maintainability than inline script content

== Summary

**✓ conda-forge Integration Status**

This package integrates conda-forge dependencies for key third-party libraries. Three dependencies (`nlohmann_json`, `spdlog`, `utfcpp`) are sourced from conda-forge rather than bundled with the source code.

**Current Implementation:**
- ✓ **BUILD SUCCESS** - Package compiles and links correctly with conda-forge dependencies
- ✓ Reduced Complexity: No bundled dependency downloads or compilations for external libraries
- ✓ Automatic Detection: CMake finds conda-forge packages without manual configuration
- ✓ License Compliance: Proper license attribution with reduced maintenance burden
- ✓ Package Quality: Generated conda package contains all expected components
- ✓ Clean Build Script: External `build.nu` file replaces inline script content for better organization

**Package Verification:**
- ✓ mumble-server binary: `bin/mumble-server`
- ✓ Service configuration: `etc/mumble/service.yaml`
- ✓ License compliance: `share/licenses/mumble-server/`
- ✓ Clean package contents (no bundled dependency artifacts)
- ✓ Correct runtime dependency declarations

**Future Considerations:**
1. **Cross-platform testing** - macOS and Windows build verification
2. **Runtime validation** - Server functionality testing with conda-forge dependencies
3. **Phase 2 evaluation** - tracy and soci migration feasibility assessment
4. **Performance analysis** - Comparison with alternative approaches
5. **Feedstock readiness** - conda-forge feedstock submission preparation

This approach demonstrates effective conda package modernization by leveraging the conda-forge ecosystem while maintaining build reliability and compliance requirements. The extraction of build logic to external nushell scripts follows conda-forge best practices for maintainable recipe organization.

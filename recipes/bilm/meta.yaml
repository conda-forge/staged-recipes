  summary: 'Tensorflow implementation of the pretrained biLM used to compute ELMo representations from "Deep contextualized word representations".'
  description: |
    ELMo is a deep contextualized word representation that models both (1) complex characteristics 
    of word use (e.g., syntax and semantics), and (2) how these uses vary across linguistic contexts 
    (i.e., to model polysemy). These word vectors are learned functions of the internal states of a 
    deep bidirectional language model (biLM), which is pre-trained on a large text corpus. They can 
    be easily added to existing models and significantly improve the state of the art across a broad 
    range of challenging NLP problems, including question answering, textual entailment and sentiment 
    analysis.

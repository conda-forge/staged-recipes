build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/meta.html#building-noarch-packages for more details.

  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.

  description: |
    mrcz is a package designed to supplement the venerable MRC image file format 
    with a highly efficient compressed variant, using the blosc meta-compressor 
    library to shrink files on disk and greatly accelerate file input/output 
    for the era of "Big Data" in electron and optical microscopy.

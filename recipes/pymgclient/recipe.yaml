  description: |
    pymgclient is a Memgraph database adapter for Python programming
    language compliant with the DB-API 2.0 specification described by PEP 249.

    mgclient module is the current implementation of the adapter. It is
    implemented in C as a wrapper around mgclient, the official Memgraph
    client library. As a C extension, it is only compatible with the CPython
    implementation of the Python programming language.

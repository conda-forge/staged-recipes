build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python for more details.
  # noarch: python
  number: 0
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  script: "{{ PYTHON }} -m pip install . -vv"
  skip: True # [py<35]

requirements:
  build:
    # If your project compiles code (such as a C extension) then add the required compilers as separate entries here.
    # Compilers are named 'c', 'cxx' and 'fortran'.

  description: |
    find-kedro is a small library to enhance your kedro experience. It looks through your modules to find kedro pipelines,
    nodes, and iterables (lists, sets, tuples) of nodes. It then assembles them into a dictionary of pipelines, each module
    will create a separate pipeline, and __default__ being a combination of all pipelines. This format is compatible with
    the kedro _create_pipelines format.

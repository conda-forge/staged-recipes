  description: |
    See how the two windows above look the same? That's the idea; they also
    look the same to the code that renders to them. Yet, the GUI systems are
    very different (Qt vs glfw in this case). Now that's a powerful
    abstraction!

    * Provide a generic canvas API to render to.
    * Provide an event loop for scheduling events and draws.
    * Provide a simple but powerful event system with standardized event objects.
    * Provide various canvas implementations:
        * One that is light and easily installed (glfw).
        * For various GUI libraries (e.g. qt and wx), so visuzalizations can be embedded in a GUI.
        * For specific platforms (e.g. Jupyter, browser).

    The main use-case is rendering with wgpu, but rendercanvascan be used by
    anything that can render based on a window-id or by producing bitmap
    images.

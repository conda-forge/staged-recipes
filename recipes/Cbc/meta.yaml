  summary: 'COIN-OR branch and cut (Cbc)'
  description: |
    Cbc (Coin-or branch and cut) is an open-source mixed integer linear
    programming solver written in C++. It can be used as a callable library or
    using a stand-alone executable. It can be called through AIMMS (through the
    AIMMSlinks project), AMPL (natively), CMPL, GAMS (through the GAMSlinks
    project), JuMP, Mathematica, MiniZinc, MPL (through the CoinMP project), PuLP,
    Python (e.g., cbcpy), and OpenSolver for Excel, among others.

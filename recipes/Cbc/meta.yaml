    using a stand-alone executable. It can be called through AIMMS (through the
    AIMMSlinks project), AMPL (natively), CMPL, GAMS (through the GAMSlinks
    project), JuMP, Mathematica, MiniZinc, MPL (through the CoinMP project), PuLP,
    Python (e.g., cbcpy), and OpenSolver for Excel, among others.

  summary: 'A utility belt for advanced users of python-requests'
  description: |
    This is just a collection of utilities for python-requests, but don't
    really belong in requests proper. The minimum tested requests version is
    2.1.0. In reality, the toolbelt should work with 2.0.1 as well, but some
    idiosyncracies prevent effective or sane testing on that version.

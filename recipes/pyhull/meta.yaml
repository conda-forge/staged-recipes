  summary: 'Pyhull is a Python wrapper to Qhull (http://www.qhull.org/) for the computation of the convex hull'

  description: |
    Pyhull is a Python wrapper to Qhull (http://www.qhull.org/) for the computation of the convex hull, Delaunay
    triangulation and Voronoi diagram. It is written as a Python C extension, with both high-level and low-level
    interfaces to qhull.
    Pyhull has been tested to scale to 10,000 7D points for convex hull calculations (results in ~ 10 seconds),
    and 10,000 6D points for Delaunay triangulations and Voronoi tesselations (~ 100 seconds). Higher number of
    points and higher dimensions should be accessible depending on your machine, but may take a significant
    amount of time.

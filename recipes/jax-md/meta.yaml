  summary: 'Accelerated, Differentiable, Molecular Dynamics'
  description: |
    Molecular dynamics is a workhorse of modern computational condensed 
    matter physics. It is frequently used to simulate materials to observe
    how small scale interactions can give rise to complex large-scale 
    phenomenology. Most molecular dynamics packages (e.g. HOOMD Blue or 
    LAMMPS) are complicated, specialized pieces of code that are many 
    thousands of lines long. They typically involve significant code 
    duplication to allow for running simulations on CPU and GPU. 
    Additionally, large amounts of code is often devoted to taking 
    derivatives of quantities to compute functions of interest 
    (e.g. gradients of energies to compute forces).

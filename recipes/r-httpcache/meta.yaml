  summary: In order to improve performance for HTTP API clients, 'httpcache' provides simple
    tools for caching and invalidating cache. It includes the HTTP verb functions GET,
    PUT, PATCH, POST, and DELETE, which are drop-in replacements for those in the 'httr'
    package. These functions are cache-aware and provide default settings for cache
    invalidation suitable for RESTful APIs; the package also enables custom cache-management
    strategies. Finally, 'httpcache' includes a basic logging framework to facilitate
    the measurement of HTTP request time and cache performance.

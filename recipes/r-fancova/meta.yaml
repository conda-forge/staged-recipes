  summary: A collection of R functions to perform nonparametric analysis of covariance for regression
    curves or surfaces. Testing the equality or parallelism of nonparametric curves
    or surfaces is equivalent to analysis of variance (ANOVA) or analysis of covariance
    (ANCOVA) for one-sample functional data. Three different testing methods are available
    in the package, including one based on L-2 distance, one based on an ANOVA statistic,
    and one based on variance estimators.

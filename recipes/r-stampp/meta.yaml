  summary: Allows users to calculate pairwise Nei's Genetic Distances (Nei 1972), pairwise Fixation
    Indexes (Fst) (Weir & Cockerham 1984) and also Genomic Relationship matrixes following
    Yang et al. (2010) in mixed and single ploidy populations. Bootstrapping across
    loci is implemented during Fst calculation to generate confidence intervals and
    p-values around pairwise Fst values. StAMPP utilises SNP genotype data of any ploidy
    level (with the ability to handle missing data) and is coded to utilise multithreading
    where available to allow efficient analysis of large datasets. StAMPP is able to
    handle genotype data from genlight objects allowing integration with other packages
    such adegenet. Please refer to LW Pembleton, NOI Cogan & JW Forster, 2013, Molecular
    Ecology Resources, 13(5), 946-952. <doi:10.1111/1755-0998.12129> for the appropriate
    citation and user manual. Thank you in advance.

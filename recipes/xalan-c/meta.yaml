  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    The Apache Xalan C/C++ Project provides a library and a 
    comand line program to transform XML documents using a
    stylesheet that conforms to XSLT 1.0 standards.

    The source package contains all the code to create the library,
    a command line transform utility and the documentation.

    The documentation packages provide pre-built html documents
    for web browser use.

    Binary prebuilt packages are available for some platforms.
    We could use help providing packages for more platforms.

    Xalan is a project of the Apache Software Foundation.

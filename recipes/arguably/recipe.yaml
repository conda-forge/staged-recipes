  summary: 'The best Python CLI library, arguably.'
  description: |
    arguably turns functions and docstrings into command line interfaces (CLIs).
    arguably has a tiny API and is extremely easy to integrate.
    You can also use it directly through python3 -m arguably your_script.py, more on that here.

    To use arguably in a script, decorate any functions that should appear on the command line with @arguably.command, then call arguably.run().
    If multiple functions are decorated, they'll all appear as subcommands.
    You can even have multiple levels of subcommands: def s3__ls() becomes s3 ls.

  summary: 'A switch statement for Perl, do not use if you can use given/when'

  description: |
    The module augments the standard Perl syntax with two new control 
    statements: switch and case. The switch statement takes a single 
    scalar argument of any type, specified in parentheses. switch stores 
    this value as the current switch value in a (localized) control variable. 
    The value is followed by a block which may contain one or more Perl 
    statements (including the case statement described below). The block is 
    unconditionally executed once the switch value has been cached.

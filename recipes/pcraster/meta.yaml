  summary: 'Simple, fast, extensible JSON encoder/decoder for Python'
  description: |
    PCRaster is a collection of tools and software libraries tailored
    to the construction of spatio-temporal environmental models. Application
    domains are amongst others hydrology (rainfall-runoff, global water
    balance, groundwater (with Modflow)), ecology, or land use change. Two
    scripting languages (Python and PCRcalc) include a rich set of spatial
    operations for manipulating and analysing raster maps. A Python
    framework supports Monte Carlo simulations and data assimilation
    (Ensemble Kalman Filter and Particle Filter). The Aguila tool allows
    for the interactive visualisation of stochastic spatio-temporal data.

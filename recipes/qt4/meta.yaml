  patches:
    # Make Qt accept its open source license without user interaction
    - acceptance.patch

    # Compile qmake with the system architecture. Taken from the MacPorts project:
    # https://trac.macports.org/browser/trunk/dports/aqua/qt4-mac/files/patch-configure.diff
    - qmake-arch.patch  # [osx]

    # Make Qt work with Ubuntu modifications to scrollbars for Gtk

    # On Windows, for VS 2015 (Python 3.5+), rather drastic modifications are
    # necessary because Microsoft finally got around to defining some standard
    # functions. There's the vs_2015_int.patch file that does this. The changes in this patch were
    # found in forums, and originated at (Author appears to be Peter Zhigalov):

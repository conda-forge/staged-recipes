  summary: 'Extends sparse matrix and vector classes from the ''Matrix'' package by providing:
    (a) Methods and operators that work natively on CSR formats (compressed sparse row,
    a.k.a. ''RsparseMatrix'') such as slicing/sub-setting, assignment, rbind(), mathematical
    operators for CSR and COO such as addition ("+") or sqrt(), and methods such as
    diag(); (b) Multi-threaded matrix multiplication and cross-product for many <sparse,
    dense> types, including the ''float32'' type from ''float''; (c) Coercion methods
    between pairs of classes which are not present in ''Matrix'', such as ''dgCMatrix''
    -> ''ngRMatrix'', as well as convenience conversion functions; (d) Utility functions
    for sparse matrices such as sorting the indices or removing zero-valued entries;
    (e) Fast transposes that work by outputting in the opposite storage format; (f)
    Faster replacements for many ''Matrix'' methods for all sparse types, such as slicing
    and elementwise multiplication. (g) Convenience functions for sparse objects, such
    as ''mapSparse'' or a shorter ''show'' method.'

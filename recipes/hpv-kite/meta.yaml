  summary: "HPV-Kite: HPV K-mer Index Tversky Estimator application"
  description: |
    HPV-Kite is a Java application that detects HPV within samples.
    It can be used for DNA and/or RNA FASTQ files.
    KITE stands for K-mer Index Tversky Estimator, as the application leverages
    k-mer analysis combined with the Tversky index.
    HPV-Kite not only expedites viral detection but also maintains comparable
    sensitivity to existing approaches.

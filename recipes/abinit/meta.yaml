  summary: 'ABINIT is an open-source suite of programs for materials science'

  description: |
    ABINIT is a software suite to calculate the optical, mechanical, 
    vibrational, and other observable properties of materials. Starting 
    from the quantum equations of density functional theory, you can 
    build up to advanced applications with perturbation theories based 
    on DFT, and many-body Green's functions (GW and DMFT)â€¦

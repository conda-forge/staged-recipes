  summary: A library for easily generating Quil programs to be executed using the Rigetti Forest platform.
  description: |
    pyQuil is an open source Python library developed at Rigetti Computing that
    constructs programs for quantum computers. More concretely, pyQuil produces
    programs in the Quantum Instruction Language (Quil). Quil is an opinionated
    quantum instruction language - its basic belief is that in the near term
    quantum computers will operate as coprocessors, working in concert with
    traditional CPUs. This means that Quil is designed to execute on a Quantum
    Abstract Machine that has a shared classical/quantum architecture at its
    core.

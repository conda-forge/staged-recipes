  summary: For a given data set, the package provides a novel method of computing precise limits
    to acquire subsets which are easily interpreted. Closely related to the Lorenz curve,
    the ABC curve visualizes the data by graphically representing the cumulative distribution
    function. Based on an ABC analysis the algorithm calculates, with the help of the
    ABC curve, the optimal limits by exploiting the mathematical properties pertaining
    to distribution of analyzed items. The data containing positive values is divided
    into three disjoint subsets A, B and C, with subset A comprising very profitable
    values, i.e. largest data values ("the important few"), subset B comprising values
    where the yield equals to the effort required to obtain it, and the subset C comprising
    of non-profitable values, i.e., the smallest data sets ("the trivial many"). Package
    is based on "Computed ABC Analysis for rational Selection of most informative Variables
    in multivariate Data", PLoS One. Ultsch. A., Lotsch J. (2015) <DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0129767>.

  summary: 'POSIX-compliant implementation of /bin/sh'
  description: |
    DASH is a POSIX-compliant implementation of /bin/sh that aims to be as small as possible. It
    does this without sacrificing speed where possible. In fact, it is significantly faster than
    bash (the GNU Bourne-Again SHell) for most tasks.

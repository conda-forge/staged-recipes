  summary: 'Provide missing stdint.h and inttypes.h headers for Python-2.7 Windows VC2008'
  description: |
    Include this package as a build time dependency in your meta.yaml,
    if you want to compile a package needing stdint.h or inttypes.h
    on Windows for Python-2.7. We need this, because this Python version
    is built against an old version of Visual Studio, which lacks these headers.

  description: |
    Plugin for pytest to mark tests as integration or slow integration.

    Integration tests are run after normal tests (unit tests) and slow
    integration tests are run after (quick) integration tests.

    If a unit test fails, (quick) integration and slow integration tests
    are not run.

    If a (quick) integration tests fails, slow integration tests are not run.

    If you have also installed pytest-cov, then code coverage is disabled for
    all integration tests, since unit tests are supposed to cover all the code.

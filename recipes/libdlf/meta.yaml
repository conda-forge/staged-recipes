  patches:
    # The package is originally created in `libdlf/packages/python`; this means
    # that setup.py has `use_scm_version={"root": "../../"}` etc - which
    # directories do not exist in the tarball. The following patch corrects
    # this. Ideally, this should eventually be resolved within the setup with
    # setuptools_scm.

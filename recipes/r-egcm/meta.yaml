  summary: An easy-to-use implementation of the Engle-Granger two-step procedure for identifying
    pairs of cointegrated series.  It is geared towards the analysis of pairs of securities.  Summary
    and plot functions are provided, and the package is able to fetch closing prices
    of securities from Yahoo.  A variety of unit root tests are supported, and an improved
    unit root test is included.

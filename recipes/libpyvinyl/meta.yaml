  summary: Python API for the Virtual Neutron and x-raY Laboratory
  description: |
    Simulations provide invaluable insights to plan (before) and understand (after)
    experiments at neutron and X-ray facilities. A wide set of libraries and
    programs is already available to simulate neutron and X-ray beams, propagate
    them through the beamlines, interact with the sample and get data acquired by
    detectors.

    The aim of libpyvinyl is to provide a high level neutron and X-ray simulation
    API. With this harmonized user interface we achieve seamless interoperability of
    individual simulations thereby facilitating the concatenation of simulation
    steps into a simulation pipeline. The vast differences with respect to parameter
    names, unit conventions, configuration syntax, i.e. the user interface, is,
    hence, overcome creating a libpyvinyl compliant API for each simulation
    software.

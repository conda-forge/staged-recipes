  summary: "SQLAlchemy ORM and pydantic data models for SQL storage and JSON serialization of COBRA components such as reactions, compounds, and compartments."
  description: |
    Provide SQLAlchemy ORM and pydantic data models for SQL storage and
    serialization of COBRA components such as reactions, compounds, and
    compartments. They are loosely modeled after corresponding classes from the
    [SBML Level 3 Version 2
    specification](http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications). The data models
    are primarily intended for web services but other applications may benefit
    from these, too.

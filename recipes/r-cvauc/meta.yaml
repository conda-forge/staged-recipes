  summary: 'This package contains various tools for working with and evaluating crossvalidated
    area under the ROC curve (AUC) estimators.'
  description: 'The primary functions of the package
    are ci.cvAUC and ci.pooled.cvAUC, which report cross-validated AUC and compute confidence
    intervals for cross-validated AUC estimates based on influence curves for i.i.d.
    and pooled repeated measures data, respectively.  One benefit to using influence
    curve based confidence intervals is that they require much less computation time
    than bootstrapping methods.  The utility functions, AUC and cvAUC, are simple wrappers
    for functions from the ROCR package. '

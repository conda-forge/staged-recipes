  summary: 'A package for making properties lazy'

  description: |
    Properties are a very useful feature of Python, effectively allowing 
    an attribute to masquerade as a method (with no arguments other than 
    self). However, sometimes we want to store the results of an expensive 
    computation in an attribute.

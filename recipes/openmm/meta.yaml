build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python for more details.
  # noarch: python
  number: 0
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  skip: True  # [win]
  #script: "{{ PYTHON }} -m pip install . -vv"

  description: |
    OpenMM is a toolkit for molecular simulation. It can be used either as a
    stand-alone application for running simulations, or as a library you call
    from your own code. It provides a combination of extreme flexibility
    (through custom forces and integrators), openness, and high performance
    (especially on recent GPUs) that make it truly unique among simulation
    codes.

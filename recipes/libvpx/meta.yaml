  summary: A high-quality, open video format for the web
  description: |
    libvpx is a free software video codec library from
    Google and the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia).
    It serves as the reference software implementation for
    the video coding formats VP8 and VP9, and for AV1 a
    special fork named libaom that was stripped of
    backwards compatibility.

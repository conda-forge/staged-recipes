  summary: This queue is a data structure that lets parallel processes send and receive messages,
    and it can help coordinate the work of complicated parallel tasks. Processes can
    push new messages to the queue, pop old messages, and obtain a log of all the messages
    ever pushed. File locking preserves the integrity of the data even when multiple
    processes access the queue simultaneously.

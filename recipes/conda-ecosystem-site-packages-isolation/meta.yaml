  summary: 'Prevent the environment's Python from searching for packages outside the environment'
  description: |
    With respect to the list of locations searched by Python for packages, mimic the
    default behavior of virtual environments created by Python's built-in "venv" module.
    Python in the conda environment gets isolated from system site-packages, including user
    site-packages.

  summary: 'C/C++ arbitrary precision decimal floating point libraries'
  description: |
    libmpdec is a complete C implementation of the General Decimal Arithmetic
    Specification.  The specification, written by Mike Cowlishaw from IBM,
    defines a general purpose arbitrary precision data type together with
    rigorously specified functions and rounding behavior.  As described in the
    scope section of the specification, libmpdec will - with minor restrictions -
    also conform to the IEEE 754-2008 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic,
    provided that the appropriate context parameters are set.

    libmpdec++ is a complete C++ implementation of the General Decimal Arithmetic
    Specification. libmpdec++ is mostly a header library around libmpdec.  The
    library frees users from manual memory management and has an easy API with
    inline operators.

    libmpdec++ has a thread local context for inline operators and other functions
    that use the implicit context.

  summary: The MCC-F1 analysis is a method to evaluate the performance of binary classifications.
    The MCC-F1 curve is more reliable than the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
    curve and the Precision-Recall (PR)curve under imbalanced ground truth. The MCC-F1
    analysis also provides the MCC-F1 metric that integrates classifier performance
    over varying thresholds, and the best threshold of binary classification.

  summary: 'A python tool for Polymer Reference Interactions Site Model (PRISM) calculations'

  description: |
    Polymer Reference Interaction Site Model (PRISM) theory describes the
    equilibrium spatial-correlations of liquid-like polymer systems including
    melts, blends, solutions, block copolymers, ionomers, liquid crystal
    forming polymers and nanocomposites. Using PRISM theory, one can calculate
    thermodynamic (e.g., second virial coefficients, Flory-Huggins interaction
    parameters, potentials of mean force) and structural (eg., pair correlation
    functions, structure factors) information for these macromolecular
    materials.  pyPRISM is a Python-based, open-source framework for conducting
    PRISM theory calculations. This framework aims to simplify PRISM-based
    studies by providing a user-friendly scripting interface for setting up and
    numerically solving the PRISM equations. pyPRISM also provides data
    structures, functions, and classes that streamline PRISM calculations,
    allowing pyPRISM to be extended for use in other tasks such as the
    coarse-graining of atomistic simulation force-fields or the modeling of
    experimental scattering data. The goal of this framework is to reduce the
    barrier to correctly and appropriately using PRISM theory and to provide a
    platform for rapid calculations of the structure and thermodynamics of
    polymeric fluids and nanocomposites.

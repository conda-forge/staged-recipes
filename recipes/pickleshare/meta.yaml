  summary: 'File system based database that uses python pickles '
  description: |
    PickleShare - a small 'shelve' like datastore with concurrency support
    Like shelve, a PickleShareDB object acts like a normal dictionary. 
    Unlike shelve, many processes can access the database simultaneously. 
    Changing a value in database is immediately visible to other processes 
    accessing the same database.
    Concurrency is possible because the values are stored in separate files. 
    Hence the "database" is a directory where all files are governed by PickleShare.
    Both python2 and python3 are supported.

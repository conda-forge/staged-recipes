  summary: 'special objects which serve as mostly-transparent wrappers around another object'
  description: |
    Proxies are special objects which serve as mostly-transparent wrappers
    around another object, intervening in the apparent behavior of the wrapped
    bject only when necessary to apply the policy (e.g., access checking,
    location brokering, etc.) for which the proxy is responsible.
    zope.proxy is implemented via a C extension module, which lets it do things
    like lie about its own __class__ that are difficult in pure Python (and
    were completely impossible before metaclasses). It also proxies all the
    internal slots (such as __int__/__str__/__add__).

  summary: A command-line tool that consolidates multiple text files into a single portable archive
  description: |
    paktxt is a command-line tool that consolidates multiple text files into a single 
    structured .paktxt file and accurately restores them with original directory structure 
    and executable flags. It features git-aware file scanning, intelligent filtering of 
    binaries and temp files, and supports both clipboard and file-based operations.

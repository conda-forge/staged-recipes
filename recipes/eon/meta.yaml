  summary: 'EON: Long timescale dynamics'
  description: |
    The EON software package contains a set of algorithms used primarily
    to model the evolution of atomic scale systems over long time scales. 
    Standard molecular dynamics algorithms, based upon solving Newton’s 
    equations, are limited by the femtosecond time scale of atomic 
    vibrations. EON simulations are designed for rare event systems where 
    the interesting dynamics can be described by fast transition between
    stable states.

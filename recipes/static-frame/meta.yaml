  summary: 'Immutable structures for one- and two-dimensional calculations with labelled axis'

  description: |
    The StaticFrame library consists of the Series and Frame, immutable data structures 
    for one- and two-dimensional calculations with self-aligning, labelled axis. 
    StaticFrame offers an alternative to Pandas. While many interfaces for data 
    extraction and manipulation are similar to Pandas, StaticFrame deviates from Pandas 
    in many ways: all data is immutable, and all indices must be unique; all vector 
    processing uses NumPy, and the full range of NumPy data types is preserved; 
    the implementation is concise and lightweight; consistent naming and interfaces 
    are used throughout; and flexible approaches to iteration and function application, 
    with built-in options for parallelization, are provided.

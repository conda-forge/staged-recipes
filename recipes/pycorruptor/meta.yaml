  summary: 'A Python Toolbox for Data Corruption'
  description: |
    In data analysis and modeling, sometimes we may need to corrupt the original data to achieve our goal, 
    for instance, evaluating models' ability to reconstruct corrupted data or assessing the model's performance 
    on only partially-observed data. PyCorruptor is such a tool to help you corrupt your data, which provides 
    several patterns to create missing values in the given data.

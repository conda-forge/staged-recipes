build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/meta.html#building-noarch-packages for more details.

requirements:
  build:
    - toolchain  # [unix]
    - boost  # [unix]
    # if your project compiles code (such as a C extension) then add `toolchain` as a build requirement.
  run:

test:
  # Some package might need a `test/commands` key to check CLI.
  # List all the packages/modules that `run_test.py` imports.

    Vowpal Wabbit is a machine learning system which pushes the frontier of
    machine learning with techniques such as online, hashing, allreduce, 
    eductions, learning2search, active, and interactive learning.
    http://hunch.net/~vw/, but includes an optional C extension for a serious
    speed boost.

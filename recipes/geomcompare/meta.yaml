  summary: "Compare two sets of geometrical features."
  description: |
    GeomCompare provides multiple tools for comparing two independant
    sets of geometrical features. It can be used to identify features
    with similar geometry (based on pre-defined similarity functions)
    found in both sets, as well features with geometry that are found
    in only one of the sets. GeomCompare defines a few similarity
    functions, but it possible for the user to define its own
    customized similarity functions.

  summary: "A tool for interactive exploration of the results from 'omics' experiments to facilitate
    novel discoveries from high-throughput biology. The software includes R functions
    for the 'bioinformatician' to deposit study metadata and the outputs from statistical
    analyses (e.g. differential expression, enrichment). These results are then exported
    to an interactive JavaScript dashboard that can be interrogated on the user's
    local machine or deployed online to be explored by collaborators. The dashboard
    includes 'sortable' tables, interactive plots including network visualization, and
    fine-grained filtering based on statistical significance."

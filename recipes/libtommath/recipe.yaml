  summary: A free open source portable number theoretic multiple-precision integer library
  description: |
    LibTomMath is a free open source portable number theoretic multiple-precision
    integer library written entirely in C. It's designed to provide a simple to work
    with API that provides fairly efficient routines that build out of the box without
    configuration. The library builds with GCC 2.95 and up as well as Visual C++ v6.00
    and supports both static and dynamic linking.

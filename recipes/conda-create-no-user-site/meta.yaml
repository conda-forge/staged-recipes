  summary: conda create will configure Python to ignore packages outside the environment
  description: >
    This package extends `conda create` to configure Python so it will ignore packages
    installed with `pip install --user`. Envrionment creation will now add a
    prefix-level "pyvenv.cfg" file with the line `include-system-site-packages = false`,
    which gets read by Python's `site` module whenver Python is run. This aligns Python
    in conda environments with the default behavior of virtual environments created by
    Python's `venv` module.

  summary: 'Test for warnings and the lack of them'

  description: |
     If you've ever tried to use Test::NoWarnings to
     confirm there are no warnings generated by your
     tests, combined with the convenience of done_testing
     to not have to declare a test count, you'll have
     discovered that these two features do not play well
     together, as the test count will be calculated before
     the warnings test is run, resulting in a TAP error.
     (See examples/test_nowarnings.pl in this distribution
     for a demonstration.)

  description: |
    pykerberos is a high-level wrapper for Kerberos (GSSAPI) operations. The
    goal is to avoid having to build a module that wraps the entire
    Kerberos.framework and instead offer a limited set of functions that do
    what is needed for client/server Kerberos authentication.

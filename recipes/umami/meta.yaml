  summary: "Umami is a package for calculating objective functions or objective function components for landscape evolution modeling."

  description: |
      Umami is a package for calculating objective functions or objective
      function components for landscape evolution modeling. Umami offers two
      primary classes: a Residual which represents the difference between model
      and data, and Metric which is a calculated value on either model or data.
      A set of currently supported calculations are found in the
      umami.calculations submodule. Umami is built on top of the Landlab
      Toolkit and designed to work well with terrainbento.

+# linetimer: A small Python class to measure the time taken by indented lines.
+
+[linetimer](https://pypi.org/project/linetimer/) is a small Python class to quickly measure the time taken by a block of indented lines
+
+# Installation
+
+To install the library, simply type in `pip install linetimer` in your terminal.
+
+# Usage
+
+The basic usage is:
+
+```
+from linetimer import CodeTimer
+
+with CodeTimer():
+   line_to_measure()
+   another_line()
+   # etc...
+```
+
+Which will show the following after the indented line(s) finishes executing:
+
+```
+Code block took: x.xxx ms
+```
+
+You can also **name the code blocks** you want to measure:
+
+```
+with CodeTimer('loop 1'):
+   for i in range(100000):
+      pass
+
+with CodeTimer('loop 2'):
+   for i in range(100000):
+      pass
+
+Code block 'loop 1' took: 4.991 ms
+Code block 'loop 2' took: 3.666 ms
+```
+
+And **nest** them:
+
+```
+with CodeTimer('Outer'):
+   for i in range(100000):
+      pass
+
+   with CodeTimer('Inner'):
+      for i in range(100000):
+         pass
+
+   for i in range(100000):
+      pass
+
+Code block 'Inner' took: 2.382 ms
+Code block 'Outer' took: 10.466 ms
+```
+
+To **get the time taken in different units**, use the `unit` parameter:
+```
+with CodeTimer('Block', unit='h'):
+   slow_function()
+   
+Code block 'Block' took: 2.382 h
+```
+
+Supported units are ns, us, ms, s , m, h corresponding to nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds, seconds, minutes, hours.
+
+If you need to **retain the time taken**, you can do it with:
+```
+ct = CodeTimer()
+
+with ct:
+   slow_function()
+   
+ct.took # This contains the time taken as per the unit provided (milliseconds by default)
+```
+
+Sometimes you want to **use your own dedicated logger**, you can do it with:
+```
+import logging
+my_logger = logging.get_logger('xyz')
+
+with CodeTimer('Block', unit='h', logger_func = my_logger.info):
+   slow_function()
+```
+This will log to an appropriate handler,
+```
+INFO - Code block 'Block' took: 2.382 h
+```
+
+If you need to **turn off the printed statements**, use the `silent=True` argument
+
+```
+with CodeTimer(silent=True):
+   slow_function()
+   
+# There will be no printed output
+```
+
+You can also use **function decorator** syntax, like this:
+
+```
+from linetimer import linetimer
+
+@linetimer()
+def my_function(a, b):
+   pass
+
+my_function('a', 'b')
+
+>>> Code block 'my_function' took x.yz ms
+
+@linetimer(show_args=True) # will print function parameters
+def my_function(a, b):
+   pass
+
+my_function('a', b='b')
+
+>>> Code block 'my_function('a', b='b') took x.yz ms
+
+```
+
+Now you can add threshold to log only necessary statements, which have execution
+time greater than equal to given threshold value.
+
+By default, threshold is set to 'None', i.e., no threshold.
+
+Threshold value is set in specified unit.
+For e.g., To set threshold value to 1 second, 
+- unit='ns' => threshold=1000000000
+- unit='us' => threshold=1000000
+- unit='ms' => threshold=1000
+- unit='s' => threshold=1
+- unit='m' => threshold=1/60
+- unit='h' => threshold=1/3600
+```
+from linetimer import linetimer
+
+@linetimer(threshold=None)
+def my_function():
+   pass
+
+my_function()
+
+>>> Code block 'my_function' took x.yz ms
+
+@linetimer(threshold=1000) # will log only when execution time is >= 1000 milliseconds
+def my_function():
+   pass
+
+my_function()
+
+>>> Code block 'my_function' took x.yz ms
+
+@linetimer(unit='us', threshold=1000) # will log only when execution time is >= 1000 microseconds
+def my_function():
+   pass
+
+my_function()
+
+>>> Code block 'my_function' took x.yz us
+
+@linetimer(unit='ns', threshold=1000) # will log only when execution time is >= 1000 nanoseconds
+def my_function():
+   pass
+
+my_function()
+
+>>> Code block 'my_function' took x.yz ns
+
+```

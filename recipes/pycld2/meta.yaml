build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/meta.html#building-noarch-packages for more details.
  # noarch: python
  number: 0
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  script: python -m pip install --no-deps --ignore-installed .

requirements:
  build:
    - python
    - pip
    # if your project compiles code (such as a C extension) then add `toolchain` as a build requirement.

    - python

test:
  # Some package might need a `test/commands` key to check CLI.
  # List all the packages/modules that `run_test.py` imports.

  description: |
    This package contains the CLD (Compact Language Detection) library as maintained
    by Dick Sites (https://code.google.com/p/cld2/). The first fork was done at
    revision r161. It also contains python bindings that were originally created
    by Mike McCandless. The bindings here differ than upstream by making the full
    set of languages the default option supporting more than 165 languages!
    The goal of this project is to consolidate the upstream library with its
    bindings, so the user can pip install one package instead of two.

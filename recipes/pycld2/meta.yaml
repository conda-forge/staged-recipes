  summary: 'This package contains the CLD (Compact Language Detection) library.'

  description: |
    This package contains the CLD (Compact Language Detection) library as maintained
    by Dick Sites (https://code.google.com/p/cld2/). The first fork was done at
    revision r161. It also contains python bindings that were originally created
    by Mike McCandless. The bindings here differ than upstream by making the full
    set of languages the default option supporting more than 165 languages!
    The goal of this project is to consolidate the upstream library with its
    bindings, so the user can pip install one package instead of two.

  summary: Create interactive manhattan, Q-Q and volcano plots that are usable from the R console,
    in 'Dash' apps, in the 'RStudio' viewer pane, in 'R Markdown' documents, and in
    'Shiny' apps. Hover the mouse pointer over a point to show details or drag a rectangle
    to zoom. A manhattan plot is a popular graphical method for visualizing results
    from high-dimensional data analysis such as a (epi)genome wide association study
    (GWAS or EWAS), in which p-values, Z-scores, test statistics are plotted on a scatter
    plot against their genomic position. Manhattan plots are used for visualizing potential
    regions of interest in the genome that are associated with a phenotype. Interactive
    manhattan plots allow the inspection of specific value (e.g. rs number or gene name)
    by hovering the mouse over a cell, as well as zooming into a region of the genome
    (e.g. a chromosome) by dragging a rectangle around the relevant area. This work
    is based on the 'qqman' package and the 'plotly.js' engine. It produces similar
    manhattan and Q-Q plots as the 'manhattan' and 'qq' functions in the 'qqman' package,
    with the advantage of including extra annotation information and interactive web-based
    visualizations directly from R. Once uploaded to a 'plotly' account, 'plotly' graphs
    (and the data behind them) can be viewed and modified in a web browser.

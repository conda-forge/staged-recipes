# When building ISIS for a public release, be sure that these variables are properly set to reflect
# your current build. Keep in mind that these values are how conda build names its .tar.bz2 build
# file, and so must be unique to other builds sitting in the USGS-Astrogeology channel on Anaconda
# Cloud, or they will be overwritten when you upload this current build. It is always a good idea to
# confirm that you will not be overwriting a file that has already been uploaded by checking the
# channel before building.

# Also keep in mind that there must already be a Release or a Tag by the name <version>_<build_number>
# on the USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3 repo before invoking the conda build system as this will pull the
# tar.gz of that name to build. After pushing changes for a release build (so as to
# include these changes in the release), but before building using the conda build system, be
# sure to create this Release or Tag.

# This is the version of ISIS that you are building. (Please refer to
# RFC2 (https://github.com/USGS-Astrogeology/ISIS3/wiki/RFC2:-Release-Process) if you are not sure
# about what version you are building.)
# Examples:
#       A Public Release for ISIS3.6.1:                        {% set version = "3.6.1" %}
#       A Release Candidate for ISIS3.6.1:                     {% set version = "3.6.1_RC" %}
#       A custom build of ISIS3.6.1 for the CaSSIS mission:    {% set version = "3.6.1_cassis" %}
{% set version = "1.0.0" %}

# This is the build number for the current version you are building. If this is the first build of
# this version, the build number will be 0. It is incremented by 1 with every consecutive build of
# the same version.
{% set build_number = "0" %}

  summary: 'An active fork of curl-impersonate with more versions and build targets. A series of patches that make curl requests look like Chrome and Firefox.'
  description: |
    A special build of curl that can impersonate the four major browsers: 
    Chrome, Edge, Safari and Firefox. curl-impersonate is able to perform 
    TLS and HTTP handshakes that are identical to that of a real browser.
    curl-impersonate can be used either as a command line tool, similar to 
    the regular curl, or as a library that can be integrated instead of 
    the regular libcurl.

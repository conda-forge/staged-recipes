    ## Nebullvm

    > _**All-in-one library that allows you to test multiple DL compilers in one line of code and speed up the inference of your DL models by 5-20 times.**_

    This repository contains the opensource `nebullvm` package, an opensource project
    aiming to reunite all the opensource AI compilers under the same easy-to-use interface.

    You will love this library if:<br />
    🚀 you want to speed up the response time of your AI models;\
    👟 you don't want to test all DL compilers on the market, 
    but you just want to know the best one for your specific application;\
    🥇 you enjoy simplifying complex problems: in fact with one 
    line of code you can know which DL compiler is best suited for your 
    application;\
    💙 you are passionate about AI performance optimization.

    We designed something that is super easy to use: you just need to 
    input your DL model and you will automatically get back an 
    optimized version of the model for the hardware where you performed 
    the optimization.

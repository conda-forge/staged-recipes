  summary: 'Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database'

  description: |
    Kyoto Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The database is a simple data file containing
    records, each is a pair of  a key and a value. Every key and value is serial bytes with variable length. Both binary
    data and character string can be used as a key and a value. Each key must be unique within a database. There is
    neither concept of data tables nor data types. Records are organized in hash table or B+ tree.

    Kyoto Cabinet runs very fast. For example, elapsed time to store one million records is 0.9 seconds for hash
    database, and 1.1 seconds for B+ tree database. Moreover, the size of database is very small. For example,
    overhead for a record is 16 bytes for hash database, and 4 bytes for B+ tree database. Furthermore, scalability of
    Kyoto Cabinet is great. The database size can be up to 8EB (9.22e18 bytes).

    Kyoto Cabinet is written in the C++ language, and provided as API of C++, C, Java, Python, Ruby, Perl, and
    Lua. Kyoto Cabinet is available on platforms which have API conforming to C++03 with the TR1 library
    extensions. Kyoto Cabinet is a free software licensed under the GNU General Public License. On the other hand, a
    commercial license is also provided. If you use Kyoto Cabinet within a proprietary software, the commercial
    license is required.

  summary: 'Fakeroot-ng is a clean re-implementation of fakeroot'

  description: |
    Fakeroot-ng is a clean re-implementation of fakeroot. The core idea is
    to run a program, but wrap all system calls that program performs so
    that it thinks it is running as root, while it is, in practice, running
    as an unprivileged user. When the program is trying to perform a privileged
    operation (such as modifying a file's owner or creating a block device),
    this operation is emulated, so that an unprivileged operation is actually
    carried out, but the result of the privileged operation is reported to
    the program whenever it attempts to query the result.

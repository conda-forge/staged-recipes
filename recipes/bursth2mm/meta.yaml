  summary: "API for using H2MM_C with FRETBursts"
  description: |
    burstH2MM is designed to make analyzing single molecule burst experiments
    with H2MM easy. bursth2MM is built to work with FRETBursts, on which it
    depends for burst search and selection. burstH2MM serves to organize and
    process the results of H2MM optimizations and acces the results of *Viterbi*
    analysis, which assigns each photon a state, and further processing
    segments the data into dwells.

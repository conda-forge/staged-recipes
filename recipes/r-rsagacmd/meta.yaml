  summary: Provides an R scripting interface to the open-source 'SAGA-GIS' (System for Automated
    Geoscientific Analyses Geographical Information System) software. 'Rsagacmd' dynamically
    generates R functions for every 'SAGA-GIS' geoprocessing tool based on the user's
    currently installed 'SAGA-GIS' version. These functions are contained within an
    S3 object and are accessed as a named list of libraries and tools. This structure
    facilitates an easier scripting experience by organizing the large number of 'SAGA-GIS'
    geoprocessing tools (>700) by their respective library. Interactive scripting can
    fully take advantage of code autocompletion tools (e.g. in 'Rstudio'), allowing
    for each tools syntax to be quickly recognized. Furthermore, the most common types
    of spatial data (via the 'terra', 'sp', and 'sf' packages) along with non-spatial
    data are automatically passed from R to the 'SAGA-GIS' command line tool for geoprocessing
    operations, and the results are loaded as the appropriate R object. Outputs from
    individual 'SAGA-GIS' tools can also be chained using pipes from the 'magrittr'
    and 'dplyr' packages to combine complex geoprocessing operations together in a single
    statement. 'SAGA-GIS' is available under a GPLv2 / LGPLv2 licence from <https://sourceforge.net/projects/saga-gis/>
    including Windows x86/x64 and macOS binaries. SAGA-GIS is also included in Debian/Ubuntu
    default software repositories. Rsagacmd has currently been tested on 'SAGA-GIS'
    versions from 2.3.1 to 9.2 on Windows, Linux and macOS.

  summary: Researchers can characterize and learn about the properties of research designs before
    implementation using `DeclareDesign`. Ex ante declaration and diagnosis of designs
    can help researchers clarify the strengths and limitations of their designs and
    to improve their properties, and can help readers evaluate a research strategy prior
    to implementation and without access to results. It can also make it easier for
    designs to be shared, replicated, and critiqued.

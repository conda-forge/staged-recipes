  summary: A dataset is said to be unbalanced when the class of interest (minority class) is
    much rarer than normal behaviour (majority class). The cost of missing a minority
    class is typically much higher that missing a majority class. Most learning systems
    are not prepared to cope with unbalanced data and several techniques have been proposed.
    This package implements some of most well-known techniques and propose a racing
    algorithm to select adaptively the most appropriate strategy for a given unbalanced
    task.

  summary: Sensitivity (or recall or true positive rate), false positive rate, specificity, precision
    (or positive predictive value), negative predictive value, misclassification rate,
    accuracy, F-score- these are popular metrics for assessing performance of binary
    classifier for certain threshold. These metrics are calculated at certain threshold
    values. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is a common tool for assessing
    overall diagnostic ability of the binary classifier. Unlike depending on a certain
    threshold, area under ROC curve (also known as AUC), is a summary statistic about
    how well a binary classifier performs overall for the classification task. ROCit
    package provides flexibility to easily evaluate threshold-bound metrics. Also, ROC
    curve, along with AUC, can be obtained using different methods, such as empirical,
    binormal and non-parametric. ROCit encompasses a wide variety of methods for constructing
    confidence interval of ROC curve and AUC. ROCit also features the option of constructing
    empirical gains table, which is a handy tool for direct marketing. The package offers
    options for commonly used visualization, such as, ROC curve, KS plot, lift plot.
    Along with in-built default graphics setting, there are rooms for manual tweak by
    providing the necessary values as function arguments. ROCit is a powerful tool offering
    a range of things, yet it is very easy to use.

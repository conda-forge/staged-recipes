  summary: 'Cross-platform utilities for prompting the user for credentials or a  passphrase,
    for example to authenticate with a server or read a protected key. Includes native
    programs for MacOS and Windows, hence no ''tcltk'' is required.  Password entry
    can be invoked in two different ways: directly from R via the  askpass() function,
    or indirectly as password-entry back-end for ''ssh-agent''  or ''git-credential''
    via the SSH_ASKPASS and GIT_ASKPASS environment variables. Thereby the user can
    be prompted for credentials or a passphrase if needed  when R calls out to git or
    ssh.'

  summary: Provides a collection of self-labeled techniques for semi-supervised classification.
    In semi-supervised classification, both labeled and unlabeled data are used to train
    a classifier. This learning paradigm has obtained promising results, specifically
    in the presence of a reduced set of labeled examples. This package implements a
    collection of self-labeled techniques to construct a classification model. This
    family of techniques enlarges the original labeled set using the most confident
    predictions to classify unlabeled data. The techniques implemented can be applied
    to classification problems in several domains by the specification of a supervised
    base classifier. At low ratios of labeled data, it can be shown to perform better
    than classical supervised classifiers.

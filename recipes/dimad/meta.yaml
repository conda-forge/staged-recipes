  summary: DIMAD is a program which studies particle behavior in circular machines and in beamlines
  description: |
    DIMAD is a program which studies particle behavior in circular machines and in
    beamlines. The trajectories of the particles are computed according to the
    second order matrix formalism. DIMAD does not provide synchrotron motion
    analysis but can simulate it. The program provides the user with the
    possibility of defining arbitrary elements to tailor the program to specific
    uses.

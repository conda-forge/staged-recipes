  summary: Provides Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication functionality for R users of
    Microsoft's 'Azure' cloud <https://azure.microsoft.com/>. Use this package to obtain
    'OAuth' 2.0 tokens for services including Azure Resource Manager, Azure Storage
    and others. It supports both AAD v1.0 and v2.0, as well as multiple authentication
    methods, including device code and resource owner grant. Tokens are cached in a
    user-specific directory obtained using the 'rappdirs' package. The interface is
    based on the 'OAuth' framework in the 'httr' package, but customised and streamlined
    for Azure. Part of the 'AzureR' family of packages.

  summary: Is designed to test for association between methylation at CpG sites across the genome
    and a phenotype of interest, adjusting for any relevant covariates. The package
    can perform standard analyses of large datasets very quickly with no need to impute
    the data. It can also handle mixed effects models with chip or batch entering the
    model as a random intercept. Also includes tools to apply quality control filters,
    perform permutation tests, and create QQ plots, manhattan plots, and scatterplots
    for individual CpG sites.

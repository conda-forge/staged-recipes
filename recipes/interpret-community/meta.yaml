    **Microsoft Interpret Community SDK for Python**: `{{ name | lower }}`

    The Interpret Community SDK builds on Interpret, an open source python package
    from Microsoft Research for training interpretable models, and helps to explain
    blackbox systems by adding additional extensions from the community to interpret
    ML models.

    - `{{ name | lower }}`: Interpret-Community is an experimental repository that hosts
    a wide range of community developed machine learning interpretability techniques.
    This repository makes it easy for anyone involved in the development of a machine
    learning system to improve transparency around their machine learning models. Data
    scientists, machine learning engineers, and researchers can easily add their own
    interpretability techniques via the set of extension hooks built into the peer
    repository, Interpret, and expand this repository to include their custom-made
    interpretability techniques.

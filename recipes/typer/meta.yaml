  summary: 'A library for building CLI applications '

  description: |
    Typer is library for building CLI applications that users will love using and developers will love creating. Based on Python 3.6+ type hints.

    The key features are:

    Intuitive to write: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging. Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
    Easy to use: It's easy to use for the final users. Automatic help, and automatic completion for all shells.
    Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
    Start simple: The simplest example adds only 2 lines of code to your app: 1 import, 1 function call.
    Grow large: Grow in complexity as much as you want, create arbitrarily complex trees of commands and groups of subcommands, with options and arguments.

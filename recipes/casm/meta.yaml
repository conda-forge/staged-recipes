  summary: 'First-principles statistical mechanical software for the study of multi-component crystalline solids'
  description: |
    CASM is an open source software package designed to perform 
    first-principles statistical mechanical studies of multi-
    component crystalline solids. CASM interfaces with first-
    principles electronic structure codes, automates the 
    construction and parameterization of effective Hamiltonians 
    and subsequently builds highly optimized (kinetic) Monte 
    Carlo codes to predict finite-temperature thermodynamic and
    kinetic properties.

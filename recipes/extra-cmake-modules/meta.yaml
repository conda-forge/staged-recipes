  summary: 'The Extra CMake Modules package, or ECM, adds to the modules provided by CMake.'
  description: |
    The Extra CMake Modules package, or ECM, adds to the modules provided by CMake,
    including ones used by find_package() to find common software, ones that can be
    used directly in CMakeLists.txt files to perform common tasks and toolchain files
    that must be specified on the commandline by the user.

    In addition, it provides common build settings used in software produced by the KDE community.

    While the driving force of this module is to reduce duplication in CMake scripts
    across KDE software, it is intended to be useful for any software that uses the
    CMake build system.

  summary: 'Google Cloud DNS API client library'
  description: Google Cloud DNS API provides methods that you can use to manage DNS for your applications.
    Google Cloud DNS is a scalable, reliable, and managed authoritative Domain Name System (DNS) service running
    on the same infrastructure as Google. It has low latency, high availability and is a cost-effective way to
    make your applications and services available to your users. You can easily publish and manage millions of
    DNS zones and records using our API.

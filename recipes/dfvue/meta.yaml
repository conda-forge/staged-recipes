  description: |
    dfvue is a minimal GUI for a quick view of csv files. It uses an input
    panel similar to Excel to check visually that the csv file is read
    correctly. It provides most options of pandas.read_csv to be very
    versatile on possible csv formats. dfvue is a Python script that can be
    called from within Python or as a command line tool. It is not supposed
    to produce publication-ready plots but rather provide a quick overview
    of the csv file.

build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/meta.html#building-noarch-packages for more details.

  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  script: python -m pip install --no-deps --ignore-installed .

    Canmatrix implements a "Python Can Matrix Object" which describes the can-communication and the needed objects (Boardunits, Frames, Signals, Values, ...) 
    Canmatrix also includes two Tools (canconvert and cancompare) for converting and comparing CAN databases.
    
    There are several importers (read) and exporters (write) for this object.
    
    supported file formats for import:
    
        .dbc candb / Vector
        .dbf Busmaster (open source!)
        .kcd kayak (open source!)
        .arxml autosar system description
        .yaml dump of the python object
        .xls(x) excel xls-import, works with .xls-file generated by this lib
        .sym peak pcan can description
    
    supported file formats for export:
    
        .dbc
        .dbf
        .kcd
        .xls(x)
        .json Canard (open source!)
        .arxml (very basic implementation)
        .yaml (dump of the python object)
        .sym
        .xml fibex

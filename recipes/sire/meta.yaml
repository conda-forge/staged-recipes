  description: |
                Sire is a free, open source, multiscale molecular-simulation framework,
                written to allow computational modellers to quickly prototype and develop
                new algorithms for molecular simulation and molecular design. Sire is written
                as a collection of libraries, each of which contains self-contained and
                robust C++/Python building blocks. These building blocks are vectorised
                and thread-aware and can be streamed (saved/loaded) to and from a
                version-controlled and tagged binary format, thereby allowing them to be
                combined together easily to build custom multi-processor molecular
                simulation applications.

  summary: Intense parallel workloads can be difficult to monitor. Packages 'crew.cluster', 'clustermq',
    and 'future.batchtools' distribute hundreds of worker processes over multiple computers.
    If a worker process exhausts its available memory, it may terminate silently, leaving
    the underlying problem difficult to detect or troubleshoot. Using the 'autometric'
    package, a worker can proactively monitor itself in a detached background thread.
    The worker process itself runs normally, and the thread writes to a log every few
    seconds. If the worker terminates unexpectedly, 'autometric' can read and visualize
    the log file to reveal potential resource-related reasons for the crash. The 'autometric'
    package borrows heavily from the methods of packages 'ps' <doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.ps>
    and 'psutil'.

# Package: autometric
# Title: Background Resource Logging
# Description: Intense parallel workloads can be difficult to monitor. Packages 'crew.cluster', 'clustermq', and 'future.batchtools' distribute hundreds of worker processes over multiple computers. If a worker process exhausts its available memory, it may terminate silently, leaving the underlying problem difficult to detect or troubleshoot. Using the 'autometric' package, a worker can proactively monitor itself in a detached background thread. The worker process itself runs normally, and the thread writes to a log every few seconds. If the worker terminates unexpectedly, 'autometric' can read and visualize the log file to reveal potential resource-related reasons for the crash. The 'autometric' package borrows heavily from the methods of packages 'ps' <doi:10.32614/CRAN.package.ps> and 'psutil'.

  summary: Fine Free File Command
  description: |
    The file command is "a file type guesser", that is, a command-line tool
    that tells you in words what kind of data a file contains. Unlike most GUI
    systems, command-line UNIX systems - with this program leading the charge -
    don't rely on filename extentions to tell you the type of a file, but look
    at the file's actual contents. This is, of course, more reliable, but
    requires a bit of I/O.

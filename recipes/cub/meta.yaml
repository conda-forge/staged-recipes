  summary: |
    CUB is a flexible library of cooperative threadblock primitives and other utilities for CUDA
    kernel programming.
  description: |
    CUB provides state-of-the-art, reusable software components for every layer of the CUDA
    programming model:
    - Parallel primitives
      - Warp-wide "collective" primitives
        - Cooperative warp-wide prefix scan, reduction, etc.
        - Safely specialized for each underlying CUDA architecture
      - Block-wide "collective" primitives
        - Cooperative I/O, sort, scan, reduction, histogram, etc.
        - Compatible with arbitrary thread block sizes and types
      - Device-wide primitives
        - Parallel sort, prefix scan, reduction, histogram, etc.
        - Compatible with CUDA dynamic parallelism
    - Utilities
      - Fancy iterators
      - Thread and thread block I/O
      - PTX intrinsics
      - Device, kernel, and storage management

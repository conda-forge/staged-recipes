  summary: 'Tokamak edge plasma grid generator for magnetic-topologies with up to two x-points anywhere in the domain.'
  description: |
    INGRID (Interactive Grid) is a Python based tokamak edge plasma grid generator capable of automatic generation of grids for magnetic-topologies with up to two x-points anywhere in the domain. The code generates block-structured grids in three steps: 1)Analysis of MHD reconscruction code such as EFIT to identify the embedded topology. 2) Generation of the appropriate Patch map which appropriately models the domain (blocks).  3) Generation of the grid ready for export.    INGRID can be utilized in a GUI mode and noninteractively via Python scripts. Both modes of operation support the use of the YAML formatted parameter file.

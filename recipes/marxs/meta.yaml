  summary: "Multi Architecture Raytracer for X-ray satellites"
  description: |
    MARXS (Multi-Architecture-Raytrace-Xraymission-Simulator) is a toolsuite
    to simulate the performance X-ray observatories. It is primarily aimed at
    astronomical X-ray satellites and sounding rocket payloads, but can be
    used to ray-trace experiments in the laboratory as well. MARXS performs
    Monte-Carlo ray-trace simulations from a source (astronomical or lab)
    through a collection of optical elements such as mirrors, baffles, and
    gratings to a detector.

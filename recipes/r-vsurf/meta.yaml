  summary: Three steps variable selection procedure based on random forests. Initially developed
    to handle high dimensional data (for which number of variables largely exceeds number
    of observations), the package is very versatile and can treat most dimensions of
    data, for regression and supervised classification problems. First step is dedicated
    to eliminate irrelevant variables from the dataset. Second step aims to select all
    variables related to the response for interpretation purpose. Third step refines
    the selection by eliminating redundancy in the set of variables selected by the
    second step, for prediction purpose. Genuer, R. Poggi, J.-M. and Tuleau-Malot, C.

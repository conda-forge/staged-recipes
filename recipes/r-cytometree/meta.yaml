  summary: 'Given the hypothesis of a bi-modal distribution of cells for each marker, the algorithm
    constructs a binary tree, the nodes of which are subpopulations of cells. At each
    node, observed cells and markers are modeled by both a family of normal distributions
    and a family of bi-modal normal mixture distributions. Splitting is done according
    to a normalized difference of AIC between the two families. Method is detailed in:
    Commenges, Alkhassim, Gottardo, Hejblum & Thiebaut (2018) <doi: 10.1002/cyto.a.23601>.'

  summary: A fast parallelized alternative to R's native 'dist' function to calculate distance
    matrices for continuous, binary, and multi-dimensional input matrices, which supports
    a broad variety of 41 predefined distance functions from the 'stats', 'proxy' and
    'dtw' R packages, as well as user- defined functions written in C++. For ease of
    use, the 'parDist' function extends the signature of the 'dist' function and uses
    the same parameter naming conventions as distance methods of existing R packages.
    The package is mainly implemented in C++ and leverages the 'RcppParallel' package
    to parallelize the distance computations with the help of the 'TinyThread' library.
    Furthermore, the 'Armadillo' linear algebra library is used for optimized matrix
    operations during distance calculations. The curiously recurring template pattern
    (CRTP) technique is applied to avoid virtual functions, which improves the Dynamic
    Time Warping calculations while the implementation stays flexible enough to support
    different DTW step patterns and normalization methods.

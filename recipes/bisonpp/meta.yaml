  description: |
    bisonpp was created from bison by A. Coetmeur in the 1990s. 
    This program provided seamless integration with C++, allowing developers 
    to code actions in C++ and embed a parser and scanner within a class 
    by private inheritance. The latter capability allows multiple scanners a
    nd parsers to be used within a single program, 
    something that is difficult with bison.

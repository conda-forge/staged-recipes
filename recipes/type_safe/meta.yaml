requirements:
  build:
    - cmake
    # type_safe is header-only but its cmake setup is looking for a compiler to
    # build some test programs (that are not installed.)
    - {{ compiler('cxx') }}
    - make  # [not win]
  host:
    # ensure that type_safe does not vendor debug_assert
    - debug_assert >=1.3.3,<2
  run:
    # anything that uses type_safe headers is also going to need the debug_assert headers
    - debug_assert >=1.3.3,<2

    - test -f $PREFIX/include/type_safe/optional.hpp            # [unix]

  description: |
    Sodium is an easy-to-use software library for encryption, decryption, signatures, password hashing, and more.
    It is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of NaCl, with a compatible API, and an
    extended API to improve usability even further.
    Its goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.
    Sodium supports a variety of compilers and operating systems, including Windows (with MingW or Visual Studio,
    x86 and x64), iOS, Android, as well as Javascript and Webassembly.

    **Bridge your ROS workspace to the modern conda/Pixi ecosystem**

    pixi-ros helps ROS developers transition from `rosdep` to [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) for package management.
    It automatically reads your ROS workspace's `package.xml` files and generates a `pixi.toml` manifest with all dependencies resolved from conda channels (primarily [robostack](https://robostack.org/)).

    ## Why pixi-ros?

    If you're a ROS developer, you're probably familiar with `rosdep` managing dependencies.
    `pixi-ros` gives you access to a more modern package management ecosystem:

    - **Reproducible environments**: Lock files ensure everyone on your team has identical dependencies
    - **Cross-platform**: Works seamlessly on Linux, macOS, and Windows
    - **Fast and reliable**: Uses rattler (Rust implementation of conda) for speed
    - **No system dependencies**: Everything isolated in project environments

    ## Quick Start

    ### Installation

    Install pixi first if you haven't already:

    ```bash
    curl -fsSL https://pixi.sh/install.sh | bash
    ```

    Or follow instructions at https://pixi.sh/latest/installation/

    Install pixi-ros globally using pixi:

    ```bash
    pixi global install pixi-ros
    ```

    ### Initialize Your ROS Workspace

    Navigate to your ROS workspace and run:

    ```bash
    pixi ros init --distro humble
    ```

    This will:
    1. Discover all ROS packages in your workspace (by finding `package.xml` files)
    2. Read dependencies from each `package.xml`
    3. Map ROS package names to conda packages
    4. Generate/update `pixi.toml` with proper channels and dependencies
    5. Check package availability and warn about missing packages
    6. Create helpful build/test/clean tasks

    ## How It Works

    ### Dependency Mapping

    `pixi-ros` reads all dependency types from `package.xml` files. 
    It then does a best effort mapping of ROS package names to conda packages.

    - **ROS packages**: `ros-{distro}-{package}` from robostack channels (e.g., `ros-humble-rclcpp`)
    - **System packages**: Mapped to conda-forge equivalents (e.g., `cmake`, `eigen`)

    After the mapping, it validates package availability in the configured channels. This starts a connection with `https://prefix.dev` to check if packages exist.

    ### Example

    Given a `package.xml` with:

    ```xml
    <depend>rclcpp</depend>
    <build_depend>ament_cmake</build_depend>
    <exec_depend>std_msgs</exec_depend>
    ```

    `pixi ros init --distro humble` generates a `pixi.toml` with:

    ```toml
    [dependencies]
    ros-humble-ament-cmake = \"*\"
    ros-humble-rclcpp = \"*\"
    ros-humble-std-msgs = \"*\"
    ```

    ## Philosophy

    `pixi-ros` aims to be a quick **gateway drug**. It:

    - Respects existing ROS conventions (package.xml as source of truth)
    - Uses standard ROS build tools (colcon)
    - Focuses only on dependency management and environment setup
    - Doesn't replace `ros2` CLI or other ROS tooling
    - Should eventually become unnecessary as the ecosystem matures

    Think of it as a \"gateway\" to help ROS developers benefit from modern package management while keeping familiar workflows.

    This tool is build with heavy use of AI assistance and is under active development. Please report issues or contribute on GitHub!

    I (Ruben) hope `pixi-ros` can die ASAP, as all of the workflows this tool provides should ideally be native to Pixi itself. But until then, I hope this initialization tool helps you get started!

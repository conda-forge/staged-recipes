  summary: Statistical tolerance limits provide the limits between which we can expect to find
    a specified proportion of a sampled population with a given level of confidence.  This
    package provides functions for estimating tolerance limits (intervals) for various
    univariate distributions (binomial, Cauchy, discrete Pareto, exponential, two-parameter
    exponential, extreme value, hypergeometric, Laplace, logistic, negative binomial,
    negative hypergeometric, normal, Pareto, Poisson-Lindley, Poisson, uniform, and
    Zipf-Mandelbrot), Bayesian normal tolerance limits, multivariate normal tolerance
    regions, nonparametric tolerance intervals, tolerance bands for regression settings
    (linear regression, nonlinear regression, nonparametric regression, and multivariate
    regression), and analysis of variance tolerance intervals.  Visualizations are also
    available for most of these settings.

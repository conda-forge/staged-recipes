about:
  home: https://github.com/monarch-initiative/semsimian
  summary: Semsimian is a package to provide fast semantic similarity calculations 
    for ontologies. It is a Rust library with a Python interface.
    This includes implementation of Jaccard and Resnik similarity of terms in an 
    ontology, as well as a method to calculate the similarity of two sets of terms 
    (so-called termset similarity). Other methods will be added in the future.

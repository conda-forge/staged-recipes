  summary: This package provides methods of fitting bivariate lines in allometry using the major
    axis (MA) or standardised major axis (SMA), and for making inferences about such
    lines. The available methods of inference include confidence intervals and one-sample
    tests for slope and elevation, testing for a common slope or elevation amongst several
    allometric lines, constructing a confidence interval for a common slope or elevation,
    and testing for no shift along a common axis, amongst several samples.

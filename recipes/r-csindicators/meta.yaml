  summary: "Set of generalised tools for the flexible computation of climate related indicators
    defined by the user. Each method represents a specific mathematical approach which
    is combined with the possibility to select an arbitrary time period to define the
    indicator. This enables a wide range of possibilities to tailor the most suitable
    indicator for each particular climate service application (agriculture, food security,
    energy, water management, health...). This package is intended for sub-seasonal,
    seasonal and decadal climate predictions, but its methods are also applicable to
    other time-scales, provided the dimensional structure of the input is maintained.
    Additionally, the outputs of the functions in this package are compatible with 'CSTools'.
    This package is described in P\xE9rez-Zan\xF3n et al. (2023) <doi:10.1016/j.cliser.2023.100393>
    and it was developed in the context of H2020 MED-GOLD (776467) and S2S4E (776787)
    projects. See Lled\xF3 et al. (2019) <doi:10.1016/j.renene.2019.04.135> and Chou

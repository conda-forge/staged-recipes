  summary: "DRESS: Diffusive Recursive Structural Similarity on Graphs"
  description: |
    A parameter-free, self-regularising algorithm that computes a unique
    self-consistent edge similarity for any graph. Supports weighted and
    directed graphs. Applications include graph isomorphism testing,
    community detection, link prediction, and graph fingerprinting.

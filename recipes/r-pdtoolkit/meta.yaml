  summary: 'The goal of this package is to cover the most common steps in probability of default
    (PD) rating model development and validation. The main procedures available are
    those that refer to univariate, bivariate, multivariate analysis, calibration and
    validation. Along with accompanied ''monobin'' and ''monobinShiny'' packages, ''PDtoolkit''
    provides functions which are suitable for different data transformation and modeling
    tasks such as: imputations, monotonic binning of numeric risk factors, binning of
    categorical risk factors, weights of evidence (WoE) and information value (IV) calculations,
    WoE coding (replacement of risk factors modalities with WoE values), risk factor
    clustering, area under curve (AUC) calculation and others. Additionally, package
    provides set of validation functions for testing homogeneity, heterogeneity, discriminatory
    and predictive power of the model.'

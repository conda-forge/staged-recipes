  summary: Estimation of multivariate normal and student-t data of  arbitrary dimension where
    the pattern of missing data is monotone. Through the use of parsimonious/shrinkage
    regressions  (plsr, pcr, lasso, ridge,  etc.), where standard regressions fail,  the
    package can handle a nearly arbitrary amount of missing data.  The current version
    supports maximum likelihood inference and  a full Bayesian approach employing scale-mixtures
    for Gibbs sampling. Monotone data augmentation extends this Bayesian approach to
    arbitrary  missingness patterns.  A fully functional standalone interface to the  Bayesian
    lasso (from Park & Casella), Normal-Gamma (from Griffin & Brown), Horseshoe (from
    Carvalho, Polson, & Scott), and ridge regression  with model selection via Reversible
    Jump, and student-t errors  (from Geweke) is also provided.

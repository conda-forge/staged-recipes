  summary: "The golang select package."
  description: |
    We support three different variants of the golang compiler, 
    `precompiled`, which is a repackage of the builds available from golang.org;
    `cgo`, which is compiled from source by conda-forge with CGO_ENABLED=1;
    `nocgo`, which is compiled from source by conda-forge with CGO_ENABLED=0.
    In version 1 `conda` will prefer the `go-nocgo` version by default, followed 
    by `go-cgo` and then `go-precompiled`.

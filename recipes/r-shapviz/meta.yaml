  summary: Visualizations for SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), such as waterfall plots,
    force plots, various types of importance plots, dependence plots, and interaction
    plots.  These plots act on a 'shapviz' object created from a matrix of SHAP values
    and a corresponding feature dataset. Wrappers for the R packages 'xgboost', 'lightgbm',
    'fastshap', 'shapr', 'h2o', 'treeshap', 'DALEX', and 'kernelshap' are added for
    convenience.  By separating visualization and computation, it is possible to display
    factor variables in graphs, even if the SHAP values are calculated by a model that
    requires numerical features. The plots are inspired by those provided by the 'shap'
    package in Python, but there is no dependency on it.

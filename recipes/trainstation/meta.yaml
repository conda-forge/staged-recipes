  summary: 'Convenient training of linear models'
  description: |
    trainstation is a tool that allows the efficient construction of 
    linear models. It provides supplementary functionality for handling 
    data and model metrics and relies on the scikit-learn library for the
    actual training. trainstation has been originally developed to aid
    the construction of force constant (via hiphive) andcluster expansions
    (via icet). Since it has proven to be valuable in more general
    contexts and to simplify the maintenance of the two aforementioned
    packages, the functionality has been moved into a separate package.

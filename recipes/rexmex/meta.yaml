  description: |
    **reXmeX** is a recommender system evaluation metric library.

    Please look at the **[Documentation](https://rexmex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)** 
    and **[External Resources](https://rexmex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/resources.html)**.

    **reXmeX** consists of utilities for recommender system evaluation. First, it 
    provides a comprehensive collection of metrics for the evaluation of recommender 
    systems. Second, it includes a variety of methods for reporting and plotting the 
    performance results. Implemented metrics cover a range of well-known metrics and 
    newly proposed metrics from data mining ([ICDM](http://icdm2019.bigke.org/), 
    [CIKM](http://www.cikm2019.net/), [KDD](https://www.kdd.org/kdd2020/)) conferences 
    and prominent journals.

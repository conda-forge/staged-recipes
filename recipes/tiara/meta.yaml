  summary: Deep-learning-based approach for identification of eukaryotic sequences in the metagenomic data.
  description: "Deep-learning-based approach for identification of eukaryotic sequences in the metagenomic data powered by PyTorch.

  The sequences are classified in two stages:

  In the first stage, the sequences are classified to classes: archaea, bacteria, prokarya, eukarya, organelle and unknown.
  In the second stage, the sequences labeled as organelle in the first stage are classified to either mitochondria, plastid or unknown.

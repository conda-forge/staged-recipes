  summary: '(partial) pure Python HistFactory implementation'

  description: |
    The HistFactory p.d.f. template [CERN-OPEN-2012-016] is per-se independent
    of its implementation in ROOT and sometimes, it's useful to be able to run
    statistical analysis outside of ROOT, RooFit, RooStats framework.

    This repo is a pure-python implementation of that statistical model for
    multi-bin histogram-based analysis and its interval estimation is based on
    the asymptotic formulas of "Asymptotic formulae for likelihood-based tests
    of new physics" [arXiv:1007.1727]. The aim is also to support modern
    computational graph libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow in order to
    make use of features such as autodifferentiation and GPU acceleration.

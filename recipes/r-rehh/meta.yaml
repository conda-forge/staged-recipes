  summary: 'Population genetic data such as ''Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms'' (SNPs) is often
    used to identify genomic regions that have been under recent natural or artificial
    selection and might provide clues about the molecular mechanisms of adaptation.
    One approach, the concept of an ''Extended Haplotype Homozygosity'' (EHH), introduced
    by (Sabeti 2002) <doi:10.1038/nature01140>, has given rise to several statistics
    designed for whole genome scans. The package provides functions to compute three
    of these, namely: ''iHS'' (Voight 2006) <doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0040072> for detecting
    positive or ''Darwinian'' selection within a single population as well as ''Rsb''
    (Tang 2007) <doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.0050171> and ''XP-EHH'' (Sabeti 2007) <doi:10.1038/nature06250>,
    targeted at differential selection between two populations. Various plotting functions
    are included to facilitate visualization and interpretation of these statistics.'

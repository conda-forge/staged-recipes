  summary: In base R, object attributes are lost when objects are modified by common data operations
    such as subset, filter, slice, append, extract etc. This packages allows objects
    to be marked as 'sticky' and have attributes persisted during these operations or
    when inserted into or extracted from list-like or table-like objects.

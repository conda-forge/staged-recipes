build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python for more details.
  # noarch: python
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate build.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Uncomment the following lines to limit to Python 3.5 and newer (for example)
  # skip:
  #   - match(python, "<3.5")
  # or the following to limit to Windows.
  # skip:
  #   - win
  script: python -m pip install . -vv

  summary: 'libAtoms/QUIP molecular dynamics framework'

  description: |
    The QUIP package is a collection of software tools to carry out 
    molecular dynamics simulations. It implements a variety of 
    interatomic potentials and tight binding quantum mechanics, and is 
    also able to call external packages, and serve as plugins to other 
    software such as LAMMPS, CP2K and also the python framework ASE. 
    Various hybrid combinations are also supported in the style of QM/MM, 
    with a particular focus on materials systems such as metals and 
    semiconductors.

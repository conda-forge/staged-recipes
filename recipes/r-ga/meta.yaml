  summary: An R package for optimisation using genetic algorithms. The package provides a flexible
    general-purpose set of tools for implementing genetic algorithms search in both
    the continuous and discrete case, whether constrained or not. Users can easily define
    their own objective function depending on the problem at hand. Several genetic operators
    are available and can be combined to explore the best settings for the current task.
    Furthermore, users can define new genetic operators and easily evaluate their performances.
    Local search using general-purpose optimisation algorithms can be applied stochastically
    to exploit interesting regions. GAs can be run sequentially or in parallel, using
    an explicit master-slave parallelisation or a coarse-grain islands approach.

  description: |
    py5 is a new version of Processing for Python 3.9+. It makes the Java
    Processing jars available to the CPython interpreter using JPype. It can do
    just about everything Processing can do, except with Python instead of Java
    code.

    The goal of py5 is to create a new version of Processing that is integrated
    into the Python ecosystem. Built into the library are thoughtful choices
    about how to best get py5 to work with other popular Python libraries and
    tools such as Jupyter, numpy, and Pillow.

    The py5jupyter library provides Jupyter-related functionality for py5. This
    includes the Jupyter kernels and Jupyter widgets.

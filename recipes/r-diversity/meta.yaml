  summary: Allows the calculation of both genetic diversity partition statistics, genetic differentiation
    statistics, and locus informativeness for ancestry assignment. It also provides
    users with various option to calculate bootstrapped 95\% confidence intervals both
    across loci, for pairwise population comparisons, and to plot these results interactively.
    Parallel computing capabilities and pairwise results without bootstrapping are provided.
    Also calculates F-statistics from Weir and Cockerham (1984). Various plotting features
    are provided, as well as Chi-square tests of genetic heterogeneity. Functionality
    for the calculation of various diversity parameters is possible for RAD-seq derived
    SNP data sets containing thousands of marker loci. A shiny application for the development
    of microsatellite multiplexes is also available.

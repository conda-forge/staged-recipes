  summary: 'Semiempirical Extended Tight-Binding Program Package'
  description: |
    The xtb program package provides the extended tight binding (xTB) methods,
    which were primarily designed for the fast calculation of structures and
    non-covalent interaction energies for finite systems with a few thousand
    atoms. The main parametrizations, GFNn-xTB, target molecular geometries,
    frequencies and non-covalent interactions following mostly a global and
    element-specific parameter only strategy.

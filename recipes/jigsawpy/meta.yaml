  summary: |
    jigsawpy is the python interface to JIGSAW, which is a Delaunay-based
    unstructured mesh generator for two- and three-dimensional geometries.
  description: |
    JIGSAW is a stand-alone mesh generator written in c++, based on the
    general-purpose meshing package JIGSAW. This toolbox provides a Python
    based scripting interface, including file I/O, mesh visualisation and
    post-processing facilities. The underlying JIGSAW library is a collection
    of unstructured triangle- and tetrahedron-based meshing algorithms,
    designed to produce high quality Delaunay-based grids for computational
    simulation. JIGSAW includes both Delaunay-refinement based algorithms for
    the construction of new meshes, as well as optimisation driven methods for
    the improvement of existing grids.

  summary: Non-parametric estimators for casual effects based on longitudinal modified treatment
    policies as described in Diaz, Williams, Hoffman, and Schenck <doi:10.1080/01621459.2021.1955691>,
    traditional point treatment, and traditional longitudinal effects. Continuous, binary,
    categorical treatments, and multivariate treatments are allowed as well are censored
    outcomes. The treatment mechanism is estimated via a density ratio classification
    procedure irrespective of treatment variable type. For both continuous and binary
    outcomes, additive treatment effects can be calculated and relative risks and odds
    ratios may be calculated for binary outcomes.

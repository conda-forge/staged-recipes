  summary: Reference-free method for conducting EWAS while deconvoluting DNA methylation arising
    as mixtures of cell types.  The older method (Houseman et al., 2014,<doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btu029>)
    is similar to surrogate variable analysis (SVA and ISVA), except that it makes additional
    use of a biological mixture assumption. The newer method (Houseman et al., 2016,
    <doi:10.1186/s12859-016-1140-4>) is similar to non-negative matrix factorization,
    with additional constraints and additional utilities.

  summary: Importance sampling from the truncated multivariate normal using the GHK (Geweke-Hajivassiliou-Keane)
    simulator. Unlike Gibbs sampling which can get stuck in one truncation sub-region
    depending on initial values, this package allows truncation based on disjoint regions
    that are created by truncation of absolute values. The GHK algorithm uses simple
    Cholesky transformation followed by recursive simulation of univariate truncated
    normals hence there are also no convergence issues. Importance sample is returned
    along with sampling weights, based on which, one can calculate integrals over truncated
    regions for multivariate normals.

  summary: C++ functions matching the interface and behavior of python string methods with std::string
  description: |
    Pystring is a collection of C++ functions which match the interface and
    behavior of python's string class methods using std::string. Implemented in
    C++, it does not require or make use of a python interpreter. It provides
    convenience and familiarity for common string operations not included in the
    standard C++ library.

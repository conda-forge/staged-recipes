  description: |
    pyeee is a Python library for performing parameter screening of
    computational models. It uses Efficient or Sequential Elementary
    Effects, an extension of Morris' method of Elementary Effects,
    published by Cuntz M, Mai J et al. (2015) Computationally
    inexpensive identification of noninformative model parameters by
    sequential screening, Water Resources Research 51, 6417-6441, doi:
    10.1002/2015WR016907. pyeee can be used with Python functions as
    well as external executables using libraries such as
    partialwrap. Function evaluations can be distributed with Python's
    multiprocessing or via the Message Passing Interface (MPI).

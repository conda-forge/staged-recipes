  description: |
    `TensorDict` is a dictionary-like class that inherits properties from tensors,
    such as indexing, shape operations, casting to device or point-to-point communication
    in distributed settings.

    The main purpose of TensorDict is to make code-bases more _readable_ and _modular_ by
    abstracting away tailored operations:

    ```python
    for i, tensordict in enumerate(dataset):
        # the model reads and writes tensordicts
        tensordict = model(tensordict)
        loss = loss_module(tensordict)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        optimizer.zero_grad()
    ```

    With this level of abstraction, one can recycle a training loop for highly heterogeneous task.
    Each individual step of the training loop (data collection and transform, model prediction,
    loss computation etc.) can be tailored to the use case at hand without impacting the others.
    For instance, the above example can be easily used across classification and segmentation tasks,
    among many others.

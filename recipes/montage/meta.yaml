  summary: Image Mosaics for Astronomers
  description: |
    Montage is a toolkit for assembling Flexible Image Transport System (FITS)
    images into mosaics, according to the user's custom specifications of
    coordinates, WCS projection, spatial sampling and rotation. The toolkit
    contains utilities for reprojecting and background matching images,
    assembling them into mosaics, visualizing the results, and discovering,
    analyzing and understanding image metadata from archives or the user's
    images.

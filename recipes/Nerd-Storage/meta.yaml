  description: |
    Nerd-Storage is a simple web server for sharing files on the local network.
     It supports the download of files and directories, the upload of multiple
     files at once, making a directory, updates and deletions. The user can
     also upload an existing directory as a .zip file which will then be
     extracted inside the storage as a folder.

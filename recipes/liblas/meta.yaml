  summary: Library for reading and writing the very common LAS LiDAR format.
  description: |
    libLAS is a C/C++ library for reading and writing the very common LAS LiDAR
    format (LAS 1.0/1.1/1.2 ASPRS). The ASPRS LAS format is a sequential binary
    format used to store data from LiDAR sensors and by LiDAR processing
    software for data interchange and archival. As of 2018, libLAS has been
    replaced by the PDAL project and it is in hibernation or maintenance mode.
    libLAS does not provide support for LAS or LAZ 1.4, which PDAL does.

  summary: 'Connect Tableau to your jupyter notebooks'

  description: |
    Jupytab allows you to explore in Tableau data which is generated dynamically
    by a Jupyter Notebook. You can thus create Tableau data sources in a very 
    flexible way using all the power of Python. This is achieved by having Tableau 
    access data through a web server created by Jupytab.

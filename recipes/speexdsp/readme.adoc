== About SpeexDSP

SpeexDSP is a patent-free, Open Source/Free Software DSP library derived from Speex. It was split off from the main Speex project to allow more modular use of the DSP functionality without requiring the codec components.

Key features:

* Echo cancellation
* Noise reduction
* Automatic gain control (AGC)
* Voice activity detection (VAD)
* Resampling
* Fixed-point and floating-point implementations
* Cross-platform support

== Future Considerations and Template Usage

This modernization establishes a *template pattern* for modernizing other Windows recipes:

=== Pattern for Other Recipe Modernizations

. *Identify candidates*: Look for recipes using +autotools_clang_conda+
. *Assess complexity*: Evaluate if the project has CMake support or needs custom +CMakeLists.txt+
. *Follow this template*: Use the SpeexDSP conversion as a reference
. *Key changes needed*:
** Update +recipe.yaml+ dependencies
** Create CMake configuration files
** Modernize build scripts
** Update documentation
. *Validate thoroughly*: Ensure both build process and output libraries work correctly

=== Next Steps (Optional)

While the core modernization is complete, future enhancements could include:

** *Performance benchmarking*: Compare MSVC vs MinGW build performance
** *Extended testing*: Test with various Windows development environments
** *Template documentation*: Create formal template for other recipe modernizations
** *CI integration*: Ensure Windows CI builds work with the new approach

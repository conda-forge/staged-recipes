  summary: 'No more partial writes or corruption! Wraps file streams, sockets or any callable.'

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    safer is aimed at preventing a programmer error from causing
    corrupt files, streams, socket connections or similar. It does
    not prevent concurrent modification of files from other threads
    or processes: if you need atomic file writing, other packages
    can provide that functionality.

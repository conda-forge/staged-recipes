Subject: [PATCH] lit: Add SDKROOT to environment variable passthrough list

When cross-compiling for macOS or running tests that need SDK paths,
the SDKROOT environment variable must be passed through to lit tests.

QEMU_LD_PREFIX and QEMU_CPU were added upstream in LLVM PR #111373.
This patch adds SDKROOT which is needed for:
- macOS cross-compilation (locating Darwin SDK)
- iOS/tvOS/watchOS target testing
- zig cc cross-compilation workflows

Without this, lit strips SDKROOT and tests fail to find SDK headers.

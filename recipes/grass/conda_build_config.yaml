# Pin versions for GRASS's three most critical geospatial dependencies with C/C++ ABI coupling:
# - These versions ensure build-time and runtime compatibility (ABI stability)
# - Overrides conda-forge global defaults to control exact versions GRASS links against
# - Only major.minor pinned (e.g., 3.14 matches 3.14.x) for patch-level flexibility
# - Not using latest patch releases (GEOS 3.14.1, PROJ 9.7.0) because:
#   * Pinning to minor version (3.14, 9.6) allows automatic patch updates in conda-forge
#   * Minor versions (x.y) have stable ABI; patch versions (x.y.z) fix bugs without breaking compatibility
#   * This balances stability (controlled major/minor) with security/bug fixes (automatic patches)
# - Other dependencies (Cairo, FFTW, NetCDF, etc.) use conda-forge global pins (less ABI-sensitive)

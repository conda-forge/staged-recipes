  summary: "A Python library that facilitates the initialization of complex laser pulses in simulations."

  description: |
    lasy offers many ways to define complex laser pulses (e.g. from
    commonly-known analytical formulas, from experimental measurements, etc.)
    and offers pre-processing functionalities (e.g. propagation,
    re-normalization, geometry conversion). The laser field is then exported in
    a standardized file, that can be read by external simulation codes.

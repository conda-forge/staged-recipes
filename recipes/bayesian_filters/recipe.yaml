  summary: Kalman filtering and optimal estimation library
  description: |
    Bayesian Filters - Kalman filters and other optimal and non-optimal estimation filters in Python

    > **Note**: This is a personal fork of the original FilterPy library (now renamed to Bayesian Filters). The original project can be found at https://github.com/rlabbe/filterpy
    >
    > Maintained by George Pearse, Lead MLE at [Visia](https://www.visia.ai/)

    This library provides Kalman filtering and various related optimal and non-optimal filtering software written in Python. It contains Kalman filters, Extended Kalman filters, Unscented Kalman filters, Kalman smoothers, Least Squares filters, fading memory filters, g-h filters, discrete Bayes, and more.

    This is code originally developed in conjunction with the book [Kalman and Bayesian Filter in Python](https://github.com/rlabbe/Kalman-and-Bayesian-Filters-in-Python/).

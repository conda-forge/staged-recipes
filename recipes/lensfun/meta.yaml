  summary: "The goal of the Lensfun library is to provide a open source database of photographic lenses and their characteristics."
  description: |
    The Lensfun library not only provides a way to read the database and
    search for specific things in it, but also provides a set of algorithms
    for correcting images based on detailed knowledge of lens properties.
    Right now Lensfun is designed to correct distortion, transversal
    (also known as lateral) chromatic aberrations, and vignetting.

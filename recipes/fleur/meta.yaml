  summary: 'full-potential linearized augmented planewave'
  description: |
    The FLAPW-Method is an all-electron method which within density 
    functional theory is universally applicable to all atoms of the 
    periodic table and to systems with compact as well as open 
    structures. It is widely considered to be the most precise 
    electronic structure method in solid state physics.

  summary: Integrate sequencing data (Variant call format, e.g. VCF or BCF) or meta-analysis
    results in R. This package can help you (1) read VCF/BCF/BGEN files by chromosomal
    ranges (e.g. 1:100-200); (2) read RareMETAL summary statistics files; (3) read tables
    from a tabix-indexed files; (4) annotate VCF/BCF files; (5) create customized workflow
    based on Makefile.

For tabix, we removed standard IO related functions, e.g. printf, fprintf ; also changed its un-safe pointer arithmetics. For zstandard, we removed compiler (clang, MSVC) specific preprocessing flags.

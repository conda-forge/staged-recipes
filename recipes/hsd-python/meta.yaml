  summary: 'Utilities to read and write files in the Human-friendly Structured Data (HSD) format'
  description: |
    The HSD-format is very similar to both JSON and YAML, but tries to minimize the
    effort for **humans** to read and write it. It ommits special characters as much
    as possible (in contrast to JSON) and is not indentation dependent (in contrast
    to YAML). It was developed originally as the input format for the scientific
    simulation tool (DFTB+ <https://github.com/dftbplus/dftbplus>), but is
    of general purpose. Data stored in HSD can be easily mapped to a subset of JSON
    or XML and vica versa.

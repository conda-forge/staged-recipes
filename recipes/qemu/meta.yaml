  summary: 'QEMU is a generic and open source machine & userspace emulator and virtualizer.'
  description: |
    QEMU is capable of emulating a complete machine in software without any need for hardware
    virtualization support. By using dynamic translation, it achieves very good performance. QEMU
    can also integrate with the Xen and KVM hypervisors to provide emulated hardware while allowing
    the hypervisor to manage the CPU. With hypervisor support, QEMU can achieve near native
    performance for CPUs. When QEMU emulates CPUs directly it is capable of running operating
    systems made for one machine (e.g. an ARMv7 board) on a different machine (e.g. an x86_64 PC
    board).

    QEMU is also capable of providing userspace API virtualization for Linux and BSD kernel
    interfaces. This allows binaries compiled against one architecture ABI (e.g. the Linux PPC64
    ABI) to be run on a host using a different architecture ABI (e.g. the Linux x86_64 ABI). This
    does not involve any hardware emulation, simply CPU and syscall emulation.

    QEMU aims to fit into a variety of use cases. It can be invoked directly by users wishing to
    have full control over its behaviour and settings. It also aims to facilitate integration into
    higher level management layers, by providing a stable command line interface and monitor API. It
    is commonly invoked indirectly via the libvirt library when using open source applications such
    as oVirt, OpenStack and virt-manager.

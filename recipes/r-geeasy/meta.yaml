  summary: "Estimation of generalized linear models with correlated/clustered observations by
    use of generalized estimating equations (GEE). See e.g. Halekoh and H\xF8jsgaard,
    (2005, <doi:10.18637/jss.v015.i02>), for details. Several types of clustering are
    supported, including exchangeable variance structures, AR1 structures, M-dependent,
    user-specified variance structures and more. The model fitting computations are
    performed using modified code from the 'geeM' package, while the interface and output
    objects have been written to resemble the 'geepack' package. The package also contains
    additional tools for working with and inspecting results from the 'geepack' package,
    e.g. a 'confint' method for 'geeglm' objects from 'geepack'."

  summary: 'Light-weight, simple and fast XML parser for C++ with XPath support'
  description: |
    pugixml is a C++ XML processing library, which consists of a DOM-like interface
    with rich traversal/modification capabilities, an extremely fast XML parser which
    constructs the DOM tree from an XML file/buffer, and an XPath 1.0 implementation
    for complex data-driven tree queries. Full Unicode support is also available, with
    Unicode interface variants and conversions between different Unicode encodings
    (which happen automatically during parsing/saving)

build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python for more details.
  # noarch: python
  number: 0
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.

  summary: 'Stiches mosaic images from Micron's Cockpit'

  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    StitchM stitches together mosaic images taken in Cockpit (Micron)
    into a universally readable format, currently '.ome.tiff'.
    The current output is an 16bit greyscale image when stitching the mosaic.
    Markers exported from Cockpit can be added as rectangular ROIs within the OME
    metadata stored in the image header. ROIs can be imported and displayed using
    bioformats in FIJI/ImageJ.
    Mainly for command-line use.

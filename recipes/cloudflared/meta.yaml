  summary: Cloudflare Tunnel client (formerly Argo Tunnel)
  description: |
    Contains the command-line client for Cloudflare Tunnel,
    a tunneling daemon that proxies traffic from the Cloudflare network to your origins.
    This daemon sits between Cloudflare network and your origin (e.g. a webserver).
    Cloudflare attracts client requests and sends them to you via this daemon,
    without requiring you to poke holes on your firewall --- your origin can remain as closed as possible.

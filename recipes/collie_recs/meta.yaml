  description: |
    Collie is a library for preparing, training, and evaluating implicit deep
     learning hybrid recommender systems. Collie offers a collection of simple
     APIs for preparing and splitting datasets, incorporating item metadata
     directly into a model architecture or loss, efficiently evaluating a
     model's performance on the GPU, and so much more. Above all else though,
     Collie is built with flexibility and customization in mind, allowing for
     faster prototyping and experimentation.

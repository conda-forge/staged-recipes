  summary: Most price indexes are made with a two-step procedure, where period-over-period elemental
    indexes are first calculated for a collection of elemental aggregates at each point
    in time, and then aggregated according to a price index aggregation structure. These
    indexes can then be chained together to form a time series that gives the evolution
    of prices with respect to a fixed base period. This package contains a collections
    of functions that revolve around this work flow, making it easy to build standard
    price indexes, and implement the methods described by Balk (2008, ISBN:978-1-107-40496-0),
    von der Lippe (2001, ISBN:3-8246-0638-0), and the CPI manual (2020, ISBN:978-1-51354-298-0)
    for bilateral price indexes.

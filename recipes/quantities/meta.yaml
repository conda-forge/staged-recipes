  summary: 'Support for physical quantities with units, based on numpy'
  description: |
    Quantities is designed to handle arithmetic and conversions of physical
    quantities, which have a magnitude, dimensionality specified by various
    units, and possibly an uncertainty. Quantities builds on the popular numpy
    library and is designed to work with numpyâ€™s standard ufuncs, many of which
    are already supported.

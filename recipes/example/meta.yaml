  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for Python 2.7, 3.4, and above, for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<34]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.4 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.

  skip: True  # [win]

requirements:
  build:
    - python
    # When setuptools is available add the `--single-version-externally-managed --record record.txt` above.
    - setuptools
    # if your project compiles code (such as a C extension) then add `toolchain` as a build requirement.
  run:
    - python

test:
  # Some package might need a `test/commands` key to check CLI.
  # List all the packages/modules that `run_test.py` imports.

  summary: A fast K-mer counter for high-fidelity shotgun datasets
  
  description: |
    FastK is a k‑mer counter that is optimized for processing high 
    quality DNA assembly data sets such as those produced with an 
    Illumina instrument or a PacBio run in HiFi mode. For example 
    it is about 2 times faster than KMC3 when counting 40-mers in a 
    50X HiFi data set. Its relative speedup decreases with increasing 
    error rate or increasing values of k, but regardless is a general 
    program that works for any DNA sequence data set and choice of k.

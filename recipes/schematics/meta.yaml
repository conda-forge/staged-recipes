  description: |
    Schematics is a Python library to combine types into structures, validate them, and transform the shapes of your data based on simple descriptions.
    
    The internals are similar to ORM type systems, but there is no database layer in Schematics. Instead, we believe that building a database layer is made significantly easier when Schematics handles everything but writing the query.
    
    Further, it can be used for a range of tasks where having a database involved may not make sense.

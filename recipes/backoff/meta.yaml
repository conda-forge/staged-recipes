  summary: 'Function decoration for backoff and retry.'

  description: |
    This module provides function decorators which can be used to wrap
    a function such that it will be retried until some condition is met.
    It is meant to be of use when accessing unreliable resources with
    the potential for intermittent failures i.e. network resources and
    external APIs. Somewhat more generally, it may also be of use for
    dynamically polling resources for externally generated content.

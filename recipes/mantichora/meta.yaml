  summary: 'A simple interface to multiprocessing'
  description: |
    Mantichora provides a simple interface to multiprocessing. You can
    simply give Mantichora as many functions as you need to run.
    Mantichora will run them concurrently in background processes by
    using multiprocessing and give you the return values of the
    functions. The return values are sorted in the order of the
    functions you have originally given to Mantichora. Progress bars
    from atpbar can be used in the functions.

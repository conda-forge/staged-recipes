  summary: 'Bleach is a allowed-list-based HTML sanitizing library that escapes or strips 
            markup and attributes'
  description: |
    Bleach is a allowed-list-based HTML sanitizing library that escapes or strips markup 
    and attributes. Bleach can also linkify text safely, applying filters that Django's 
    urlize filter cannot, and optionally setting rel attributes, even on links already 
    in the text. Bleach is intended for sanitizing text from untrusted sources. If you 
    find yourself jumping through hoops to allow your site administrators to do lots of 
    things, you're probably outside the use cases. Either trust those users, or don't.

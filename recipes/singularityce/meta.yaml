    SingularityCE is the Community Edition of Singularity, 
    an open source container platform designed to be 
    simple, fast, and secure.


    Singularity is a container platform focused on supporting "Mobility of
    Compute"

    Mobility of Compute encapsulates the development to compute model where
    developers can work in an environment of their choosing and creation and
    when the developer needs additional compute resources, this environment
    can easily be copied and executed on other platforms. Additionally as the
    primary use case for Singularity is targeted towards computational
    portability, many of the barriers to entry of other container solutions do
    not apply to Singularity making it an ideal solution for users (both
    computational and non-computational) and HPC centers.

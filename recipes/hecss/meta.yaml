build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure Python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # It is okay if the dependencies are not built for all platforms/versions, although selectors are still not allowed.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/maintainer/knowledge_base.html#noarch-python for more details.
  noarch: python
  number: 0
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  script: "{{ PYTHON }} -m pip install . -vv"

requirements:
  build:
    # If your project compiles code (such as a C extension) then add the required compilers as separate entries here.
    # Compilers are named 'c', 'cxx' and 'fortran'.
    # - {{ compiler('c') }}
  host:

  # Some packages might need a `test/commands` key to check CLI.
  # List all the packages/modules that `run_test.py` imports.
  imports:

  # For python packages, it is useful to run pip check. However, sometimes the

  summary: 'High Efficiency Configuration Space Sampler'
  # The remaining entries in this section are optional, but recommended.
  description: |
    HECSS is a Markow chain Monte-Carlo, configuration space sampler using 
    Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for probablity distribution sampling. 
    It provides an alternative way to create representations of systems 
    at thermal equilibrium without running a very expensive molecular 
    dynamics simulation. The theoretical foundation of the code are presented 
    in the section [Background](https://jochym.gitlab.io/hecss/Background) 
    in the [Documentation](https://jochym.gitlab.io/hecss/). 
    More detailed examples are included in the 
    [LAMMPS](https://jochym.gitlab.io/hecss/LAMMPS_Tutorial) 
    and [VASP](https://jochym.gitlab.io/hecss/VASP_Tutorial) tutorials.

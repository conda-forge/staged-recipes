  summary: 'Science library for storing numeric data arrays in a format that is open, simple, and self-explanatory.'
  description: |
    Darr is a Python science library for storing numeric data arrays in a way
    that is open, simple, and self-explanatory. It enables fast memory-mapped
    read/write access to such disk-based data, the ability to append data, and
    the flexible use of metadata. It is primarily designed for scientific use
    cases. Save and use your numeric arrays and metadata with one line of code
    while long-term and tool-independent accessibility and easy shareability
    is ensured.

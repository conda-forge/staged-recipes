  summary: A WebAssembly runtime powered by Wasmtime
  description: |
    Python embedding of Wasmtime, a fast and secure runtime for WebAssembly.
    Wasmtime is a standalone runtime for WebAssembly, using Cranelift as its
    code generator. It runs WebAssembly code outside of the web browser and
    can be used both as a command-line utility or as an embedded runtime.

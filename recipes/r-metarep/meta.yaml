# Description: User-friendly package for reporting replicability-analysis methods, affixed to meta-analyses summary. The replicability-analysis output provides an assessment of the investigated intervention, where it offers quantification of effect replicability and assessment of the consistency of findings. - Replicability-analysis for fixed-effects and random-effect meta analysis: - r(u)-value; - lower bounds on the number of studies with replicated positive and\or negative effect; - Allows detecting inconsistency of signals; - forest plots with the summary of replicability analysis results; - Allows Replicability-analysis with or without the common-effect assumption.

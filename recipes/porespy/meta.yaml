  summary: 'A set of tools for characterizing and analying 3D images of porous materials'
  description: PoreSpy is a collection of image analysis tool used to extract
      information from 3D images of porous materials (typically obtained from
      X-ray tomography). There are many packages that offer generalized image
      analysis tools (i.e Skimage and Scipy.NDimage in the Python environment,
      ImageJ, MatLab's Image Processing Toolbox), but the all require building
      up complex scripts or macros to accomplish tasks of specific use to
      porous media. The aim of PoreSpy is to provide a set of pre-written tools
      for all the common porous media measurements.

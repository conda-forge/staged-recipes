  summary: 'wflow hydrological modeling framework'

  description: |
    wflow consists of a set of Python programs that can be run on the command line
    and perform hydrological simulations. The models are based on the PCRaster
    Python framework. In wflow this framework is extended (the wf_DynamicFramework)
    so that models build using the framework can be controlled using the API.
    Links to BMI, OpenMI and OpenDAP have been made.

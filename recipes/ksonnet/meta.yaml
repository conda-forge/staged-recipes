  summary: 'A CLI-supported framework for extensible Kubernetes configurations'

  description: |
    ksonnet is a framework for writing, sharing, and deploying Kubernetes application manifests. With its CLI, you can generate a complete application from scratch in only a few commands, or manage a complex system at scale.
    Specifically, ksonnet allows you to:
    * Reuse common manifest patterns (within your app or from external libraries)
    * Customize manifests directly with powerful object concatenation syntax
    * Deploy app manifests to multiple environments
    * Diff across environments to compare two running versions of your app
    Track the entire state of your app configuration in version controllable files
    All of this results in a more iterative process for developing manifests, one that can be supplemented by continuous integration (CI).

build:
  # Uncomment the following line if the package is pure python and the recipe is exactly the same for all platforms.
  # See https://conda-forge.org/docs/meta.html#building-noarch-packages for more details.
  # noarch: python
  number: 0
  # If the installation is complex, or different between Unix and Windows, use separate bld.bat and build.sh files instead of this key.
  # By default, the package will be built for the Python versions supported by conda-forge and for all major OSs.
  # Add the line "skip: True  # [py<35]" (for example) to limit to Python 3.5 and newer, or "skip: True  # [not win]" to limit to Windows.
  skip: False
#  script: python setup.py install --single-version-externally-managed --record record.txt

#requirements:
 # build:
 #   - python
    # When setuptools is available add the `--single-version-externally-managed --record record.txt` above.
 #   - setuptools
    # if your project compiles code (such as a C extension) then add `toolchain` as a build requirement.
 # run:
  #  - python

test:
  # Some package might need a `test/commands` key to check CLI.
  # List all the packages/modules that `run_test.py` imports.
  commands:
    - python --version

  summary: 'A scikit-learn compatible library for graph kernels'
  description: |
    GraKeL is a library that provides implementations of several 
    well-established graph kernels. The library unifies these kernels
    into a common framework. Furthermore, it provides implementations of
    some frameworks that work on top of graph kernels. Specifically,
    GraKeL contains 15 kernels and 2 frameworks. The library is compatible
    with the scikit-learn pipeline allowing easy and fast integration
    inside machine learning algorithms.
